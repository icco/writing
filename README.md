A static react frontend for my blog.

You can see screenshots of my inspiration in the [inspiration folder](https://github.com/icco/writing/tree/main/public/images/inspiration)

This latest incaration is based off of static compiling MDX files.

## Features

- **Social Images**: Automatically generated OpenGraph images for all posts and the home page
- **AI-Generated Descriptions**: Optional script to generate meta descriptions using Google Gemini API (see [DESCRIPTION_GENERATION.md](./DESCRIPTION_GENERATION.md))
- **Automatic Summaries**: Posts without explicit excerpts get automatic summaries from their first paragraph
