Ok, so I actually broke my blog this week, so I couldn't post my #happy post until I fixed it. One of the downsides of artisanal web apps: it's your fault if they break. But we're back, so I'm back!

In my opinion, the more parks the better: [President Obama Designates National Monument in Maine's North Woods](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/08/24/president-obama-designates-national-monument-maines-north-woods).

I found [S4E4 - Tokyo Fashion Trip](http://pca.st/l3LK) to be a lot of fun. It's a discussion from the Penny Arcade staff on a trip to Tokyo and researching the fashion there.

[DJ Shadow feat. Run The Jewels - Nobody Speak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUC2EQvdzmY&feature=youtu.be) is one of the best music videos I've seen in years. It's so good!

Thanks to [What I liked 2016-08-14](https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/what-i-liked-2016-08-14.html), I read two great articles:

 -  [How do you decide what to work on? - Julia Evans](http://jvns.ca/blog/2016/08/16/how-do-you-work-on-something-important/)
 - [Transit Maps: Apple vs. Google vs. Transit App](https://medium.com/transit-app/transit-maps-apple-vs-google-vs-us-cb3d7cd2c362#.na5vlm9s7)

@xlr8r released a single zip containing all of their episode 450 mixes, [which is amazing](https://www.xlr8r.com/podcasts/2016/08/podcast-450-10-years/). I've had it on loop almost all week.

"[Now for the fun part.](https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/now-for-the-fun-part/)" is the next step in Mozilla Open Design, which has been fun to watch. I'm not a fan of their designs, but it's a cool process to see evolve.

[Gregory Porter: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNJUzwBNbxo&feature=youtu.be) is absolutely beautiful. It caused me to buy two of his albums.

[The Art of Japanese Cuisine in Austin: The Sushi Chef with Tyson Cole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKnSjJl9k70&feature=youtu.be) is a neat look into the background of a chef. I love videos like this. If you enjoy this film, you'll probably really enjoy [Chef's Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chef%27s_Table).

I had a blast with @mel_cantrell seeing [Manus X Machina](http://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/manus-x-machina) at the Met. It's open for a few more days, but if you can't make it, [here are some of my photos](https://www.flickr.com/search/?user_id=42027916%40N00&sort=date-taken-desc&safe_search=1&tags=manusxmachina&view_all=1).

"[What We Know About the Cyberattack on Democratic Politicians](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/08/16/us/politics/cyberattack-on-democratic-politicians-dnc.html?ref=politics&_r=2)" is a nice timeline of the cyberattacks from this presidential election.

I've been using [Fabulous](http://www.thefabulous.co/) to try and improve my habits. [Tinygain](https://tinygain.com/) looks to also be helpful, but for now, I'm sticking with one tool that's working well.

Learning how to make introductions online is pretty important. The Medium article, "[This is how adults make email introductions](https://medium.com/@s_m_i/this-is-how-adults-make-email-introductions-4c6c35a71763#.3861un4x1)" is quite a good primer.

I hope you have a great week!
