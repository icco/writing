I got a haircut\! And a shave\!

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/icco/19047743218" title="Post Shave Selfie by Nat Welch, on Flickr"\><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/360/19047743218\_b48d06f872\_z.jpg" alt="Post Shave Selfie" height="200"\></a\>

 It was raining for most of the day, so I kept it pretty mellow. I did add code coloring to my blog though.

 I keep a [geojson](http://geojson.org/) file describing where I have lived for more than a cumulative month of my life. It includes most offices and places I've considered home, although I keep remembering stuff I am missing. Github lets [you embed geojson in pages and autorenders it for you](https://help.github.com/articles/mapping-geojson-files-on-github/). So this is my map as of Saturday afternoon.

In the evening, Rohen and I went to a party with some Recursers in Brooklyn. Good times were had.
