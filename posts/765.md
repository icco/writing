A classic thing for me to build when I am bored is note taking, time tracking or wiki software. I often create some mixture of the three. If I'm not doing that I am cleaning up this site or [my personal website](https://natwelch.com).

The last few years those projects have landed in the GitHub repo [icco/etu](https://github.com/icco/etu). The current iteration of Etu is a command line journal that uses a [Notion database](https://www.notion.com/help/intro-to-databases) as its backend.

I bet you're wondering why the heck I would build something like this. Time Tracking is a classic nerd snipe. Check out [merveilles/Time-Travelers](https://github.com/merveilles/Time-Travelers) or [Feltron Annual Reports](http://feltron.com/index.html).
