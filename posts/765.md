A classic thing for me to build when I am bored is note taking, time tracking or wiki software. I often create some mixture of the three. If I'm not doing that I am cleaning up this site or [my personal website](https://natwelch.com).

The last few years those projects have landed in the GitHub repo [icco/etu](https://github.com/icco/etu). The current iteration of Etu is a command line journal that uses a [Notion database](https://www.notion.com/help/intro-to-databases) as its backend.

I bet you're wondering why the heck I would build something like this. Time Tracking is a classic nerd snipe. Check out [merveilles/Time-Travelers](https://github.com/merveilles/Time-Travelers) or [Feltron Annual Reports](http://feltron.com/index.html) for others lost in this rabbit hole.

In reality `etu` has been a long project. The first commit was in [2019](https://github.com/icco/etu/commit/f5d000ba296f0cd4aeff2e446812cdaaf03edf67), and randomly an idea catches my brain and I code it up.

Its current evolution is Go project that uses [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) for a simple to use CLI. In past iterations I just launched `vim` and captured the output buffer, but I found the UX to be faster if I just launched the UI myself. The downside of my design is the [Notion API](https://github.com/jomei/notionapi) is incredibly slow.

I did this work as a part of #decemberadventure, and a general want to fix complaints I had with the tool. The biggest complaints I had was after I made a post, viewing them was best done by going to Notion. I disliked that. So I rewrote the entire UX to use more off the shelf components, and added new list, view and delete abilities.

I also created [a homebrew tap](https://github.com/icco/homebrew-tap) to make installing on multiple machines easily.

Anyways, just wanted to write this up. Hope you're having a happy holidays.
