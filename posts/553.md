Here's another post in my continuing series on what's making me #happy.

I read through [Dribbble's Overtime with Laura Bohill](https://dribbble.com/stories/2016/02/17/overtime-with-laura-bohill). @alexbaldwin introduced me to @ghostlyferns when he visited in November. Such a cool group of people.

I loved the story about how [artists covertly scanned the Bust of Nefertiti and released the data for free](http://hyperallergic.com/274635/artists-covertly-scan-bust-of-nefertiti-and-release-the-data-for-free-online/).

Many of my friends know that I love clocks. This week I came across a bunch of fun online clocks:

 - [The "Black Standard" for binary clocks](http://www.romanblack.com/binclk.htm)
 - [Polar Clock](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1096355)
 - [Polar Clock II](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/b89c89ec6b58435956a1)
 - [Polar Clock III](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/c150b717e18d387e1b98)

I enjoyed looking at the outfits in [the Prada Fashion Show](http://www.racked.com/2016/2/25/11113148/prada-fall-2016-mfw).


In more serious news, I really enjoyed NYT's [Imagining a Rikers Island With No Jail](http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/02/24/opinion/imagining-a-rikers-island-with-no-jail.html). I've never known much about Rikers, so hearing about its current state and where it might go was quite interesting.

Finally, in book news, I finished the first two books of [The Stormlight Archive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stormlight_Archive) by [Brian Sanderson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Sanderson). The [first book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9188338-the-way-of-kings) was quite bad. A few friends had been raving about the series though, so I read the [second book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20150777-words-of-radiance), which was absolutely fabulous.

I need to figure out what I'm going to read next. I've got a bunch of nonfiction that I've been sitting on, but I want to keep reading fiction for now.

I hope you all have a great week!
