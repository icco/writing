Continuing my podcast addiction, ReplyAll's [Quit Already](https://gimletmedia.com/episode/47-quit-already/) was probably the best thing on my normal rotation of podcasts this week. It was a perfect example of why I love the internet: People with similar goals from different walks of life being brought together both online and in person to change the world.

The next thing was Pop Culture Happy Hour's [interview with Trevor Noah](http://www.npr.org/sections/monkeysee/2015/11/27/457375043/pop-culture-happy-hour-a-conversation-with-trevor-noah). I really like PCHH, and while I haven't gotten back in the habit of watching the daily show every day since Stewart left, I do like what Noah has to say. This was an interesting interview, although it covered common ground from some of his other interviews.

Oh, and I found [a talk by Debbie Milman](https://creativemornings.com/podcast/episodes/debbie-millman) that I hadn't heard, and since I love hearing her voice, it made me #happy as well.

[Alex](http://alexkawas.com/) shared this fantastic [article about linguistics and Blink182](http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/i-made-a-linguistics-professor-listen-to-a-blink-182-song-and-analyze-the-accent) which had me humming songs from middle school and thinking about California.

[J\. Cole](https://soundcloud.com/dreamvillerecords/j-cole-black-friday) and [Kendrick Lamar](https://soundcloud.com/topdawgent/kendrick-lamar-black-friday) both released "Black Friday", which were fantastic rap songs to listen to back to back.

In the engineering world, [GitHub's Metal Cloud](http://githubengineering.com/githubs-metal-cloud/) was a cool look into GitHub. This is how you're supposed to do DevOps. Google had a similar system, and as people spend more time in the cloud, you see less about this kind of work, which is a little sad.

Finally, my mom is visiting this weekend, and we went and saw [The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night\-Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Curious_Incident_of_the_Dog_in_the_Night-Time_%28play%29) which was absolutely fantastic. The acting was amazing, and the story was beautiful. I was in tears halfway through. It also had a really cool set, and really amazing use of light.

Anyways, I hope you had and have a great week.
