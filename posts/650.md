A #happy post! Ontime! Huzzah.

First things first: I got two of my life review things done. I updated [my changelog](http://life.natwelch.com) and I posted my [quarter in review](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/649).


I didn't even know some of these adaptations were coming out, but here is a list of [21 Books to Read Before They Become 2017 Adaptations](https://www.goodreads.com/blog/show/861-21-books-to-read-before-they-become-2017-s-biggest-adaptations).

I really enjoyed [Debbie Millman](http://www.debbiemillman.com/) talking to [Jonathan Adler on Design Matters](http://pca.st/bogJ).

[Rayna meets a "robot"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1E-FlguwGw&feature=youtu.be) is adorable.

[When Pixels Collide](http://sudoscript.com/reddit-place/) was an interesting writeup of Reddit's April Fools joke.

[In 2016 U.S. Special Operations Forces Deployed to 138 Nations, 70% of the World’s Countries](http://www.alternet.org/world/2016-us-special-operations-forces-deployed-138-nations-70-worlds-countries) is just an interesting read. It all makes sense, but sometimes you forget what all of those DoD $ are going to.

[The Great Laptop Stagnation](https://500ish.com/the-great-laptop-stagnation-710811fb27a8) is a decent review of the most recent Macbook Pro by @mgsiegler.

[Seattle's SR 99 Tunneling Machine Is Finally Done Digging](https://www.wired.com/2017/04/4-years-seattles-giant-tunneling-machine-finally-breaks/) is an update on my favorite infrastructure story of the past few years.

[Ubuntu Unity is dead](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/04/ubuntu-unity-is-dead-desktop-will-switch-back-to-gnome-next-year/) is a story that just kills me because of all the drama that went down when Ubuntu switched to Unity in the first place.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;2018 is the year of the linux desktop!&quot; is funny joke to a certain set of people. I am one of those people.</p>&mdash; Nat Welch (@icco) <a href="https://twitter.com/icco/status/849734084716888064">April 5, 2017</a></blockquote>

['Ghost in the Shell': 4 Japanese Actresses Dissect the Movie and Its Whitewashing Twist](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/ghost-shell-4-japanese-actresses-dissect-movie-whitewashing-twist-990956) was a fun read and take on the film.

@nayafia is awesome and is giving away [$5,000, no strings attached](https://medium.com/@nayafia/5-000-no-strings-attached-9e7b95d33e50?source=ifttt--------------1). This caused me to do a lot of research into what it would take to create a foundation. It'd be really neat to give money away with a little bit of accountability attached to promote people creating cool shit.

[Hackers Are Emptying ATMs With a Single Drilled Hole and $15 Worth of Gear](https://www.wired.com/2017/04/hackers-emptying-atms-drill-15-worth-gear/). Because no one ever remembers that in technology 80% of the work is maintenance.

[Steve Martin’s infamous Empty Booth was left empty on purpose](https://www.reviewjournal.com/entertainment/entertainment-columns/kats/steve-martins-infamous-empty-booth-was-left-empty-on-purpose-by-the-riviera-owner/) is just a funny story.

Finally, I was pretty sick last week, so spent a day and change binge watching [Shokugeki no Soma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Wars!:_Shokugeki_no_Soma), which is utterly amazing. It can be a little sexist at points, but in general has amazing writing, interesting action, and totally fantastic.

I hope you have a great week!
