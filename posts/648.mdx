So, I'm home sick with the flu (or something that looks like it at least...), and even with that, I still can't get a #happy post out on time. But that being said, here's a week's worth of links that I enjoyed.


The Dickerson Pyramid is a rather important part of SRE, and @n0r1's [Too Big To Fail: Lessons Learnt from Google and HealthCare.gov](https://www.infoq.com/news/2015/06/too-big-to-fail) is a great high level overview of it and other great SRE lessons from Google.

[Sockpuppets, Secessionists, and Breitbart](https://medium.com/data-for-democracy/sockpuppets-secessionists-and-breitbart-7171b1134cd5) is a depressing but interesting article about politics and Twitter.

[Why I Always Tug on the ATM](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/03/why-i-always-tug-on-the-atm/) by @briankrebs is a good reminder to always be vigilant for credit card fraud. I found a skimmer on the ATM around the corner from my apartment when I lived in London, so am always very paranoid about this. That being said, Krebs points out the biggest thing you can do is cover the pin key pad.

[There was a new episode of Rick And Morty](https://kotaku.com/surprise-theres-a-new-episode-of-rick-and-morty-that-y-1793930208) which was great, but the whole "lets show an episode and then you have to wait till summer" thing makes me sad.

I have a deep love of flip-slat and flip-dot displays, so watching [ORBITAL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ddsGYWCHg8&feature=youtu.be) and reading [Atlas Obscura's piece on Analog Departure Boards - ](http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/artists-are-salvaging-train-stations-analog-departure-boards) was deeply satisfying to me.

I loved NPR's video of [PWR BTTM: Live At SXSW 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3CSftO9w4&feature=youtu.be). Just great music.

Kendrick Lamar's new music video [HUMBLE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvTRZJ-4EyI&feature=youtu.be) is beautiful.

[Studio Ghibli API](https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/) is neat for my programmer friends out there.

I really enjoyed the first episode of the [Stoner](http://www.stoner.co/) podcast. It's an interesting interview show about people who consume marijuana.

Oh and I'm still enjoying [The Expanse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(TV_series)), [The Magicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magicians_(U.S._TV_series)) and [Billions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billions_(TV_series)). All three are on their second season and are doing really well.

I hope you enjoy your week!
