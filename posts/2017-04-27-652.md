Ok, so I wrote this #happy post on Sunday, and then forgot to post it... like a fool. So here is what made me happy last week.

Wired talks a little about [infrastructure in SF](https://www.wired.com/2017/04/san-francisco-kept-moving-massive-poweroutage/). This relates to [Power Outages Coinciding in LA, New York, and San Francisco](https://www.inverse.com/article/30631-lax-sf-ny-power-outages).


@sama is [trying to create an ethics document for software devs](https://qz.com/964159/the-president-of-y-combinator-sam-altman-is-leading-an-effort-to-develop-a-code-of-ethics-for-silicon-valley-in-response-to-president-donald-trump/). Hilariously [that already exists](https://www.acm.org/about-acm/acm-code-of-ethics-and-professional-conduct).

[What Happens When You Send a Zero-Day to a Bank?](https://privacylog.blogspot.com/2017/04/what-happens-when-you-send-zero-day-to.html) is just depressing.

[Plastc swiped $9 million from backers and just completely vanished](https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/4/20/15375842/plastc-bankrupt-campaign-fold-backers) is a traditional startup story.

[Histography](http://www.histography.io/) is a cool art project on history.

[The webâ€™s best hidden gems](http://www.kottke.org/17/04/the-webs-best-hidden-gems) has all kinds of cool stuff. I didn't have time to go through them all though.


Have a great week (or what's left of it...)!
