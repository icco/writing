[Parenting with the Amazon Echo](https://medium.com/@cjoh/parenting-with-the-amazon-echo-5fe46f60b865) is an article that presents one of my greatest fears: teaching people to trust technology blindly. Sure this is about a child-parent interaction, and the parent is just happy to have a break from fighting with his kid, but at a higher level, this article is terrifying.

This article is terrifying to me (and other programmers as well probably) because once you build software, you understand how innately buggy it is. Then take the fact that this broken thing, and prop it up as an ultimate truth source. Imagine a world where we trusted everything we are told, and then forget that some people can change the magical truth device to say whatever they want and that it is sometimes wrong.

That's a scary future indeed. Never stop questioning.
