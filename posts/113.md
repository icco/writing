Sunday was lowkey, just found a place to live (Gravesend) for my next two months in NYC. Farther than I had wanted, but all my other options fell apart, and this is super cheap. Went out to dinner and drinks in Astoria in the evening. Quite a nice area.

On Monday, I started out with coding up a Birthday card for my Dad. I then added a first pass at collision detection to Hyperspace. While discussing http://sadnat.com, it was discovered that happynat.com is broken. Debated fixing it, but held off.

@dmpatierno continued to express dissatisfaction in my use of titles in posts. I made some tweaks to the `<title>` tag of posts on this blog, but didn't appease all of his complaints.

I posted [about wallpapers](https://web.archive.org/web/20240913222609/https://writing.natwelch.com/post/112), and debated fixing http://walls.natwelch.com. I decided to do a quick rewrite of the site. It's now a little uglier, but loads quite quickly, so that's nice.

On the way to the Monday night talk, I talked with [Pam](https://twitter.com/pamasaur) about the fear of missing out and how RC might promote people not making healthy decisions for their bodies (correct amounts of sleep, healthy eating, posture, excersize, etc). I wonder how much of this is due to everyone being in a new place? Or just people left to their own devices?

Monday night's talk was about the history of Hash Tables by [Mark Dominus](https://twitter.com/mjdominus). Quite a nice look into different implementations that tied together a bunch of stuff from CS classes back at Cal Poly.
