Like my [2022](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/718) post, this #yearinreview is late. As it's close to twelve months late, I just want to dump a bunch of photos, and then for 2024 I'll get back on my bus. Or horse. Or bike. Or whatever we get on these days.

2023 was a weird year. I talked a bit about its chaos in [Three years at Laurel](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/728). But it was exciting if not tiring. The year ended with a lot of drama, which lent to 2024 being incredibly hard at work. 

But outside of work, it was still a good year, family, friends, etc. The big thing was we drove across the US in December. Mostly to see if we could do it, and to see how Beasley was with traveling that far. We did it, Beasley hated it. Mel graduated culinary school, we went to two fantastic weddings. Life was good.
