  A day of transitions: moving apartments and exploring the hidden arboreal
  wonders of Central Park's Ramble.

Spent my day doing two things: 

 1. Moving from Greenpoint to Gravesend.
 2. Going on a walking tour of the trees in [The Central Park Ramble](http://www.centralparknyc.org/things-to-see-and-do/attractions/ramble.html).
