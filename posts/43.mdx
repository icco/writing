I've never been a big reader of technical papers, but I should probably change that.

 * ["10 Technical Papers Every Programmer Should Read (At Least Twice)" by fogus](http://blog.fogus.me/2011/09/08/10-technical-papers-every-programmer-should-read-at-least-twice/)
 * ["10 Papers Every Programmer Should Read (At Least Twice)" by Michael Feathers](http://web.archive.org/web/20121024173845/http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2009/02/26/10-papers-every-programmer-should-read-at-least-twice)

Maybe I should start writing summaries for each paper.
