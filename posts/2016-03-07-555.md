March continues to be a month of running around and having very little free time. That being said, a lot of things made me #happy last week.

First off, I saw the movie [The Boy and the Beast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boy_and_the_Beast) on Friday. I've been sending [the trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlL7c8sQjko) around to folks, because I was really excited for this film. It's by [the same team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamoru_Hosoda) that has made some of my favorite anime films of all time, including [Summer Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Wars) and [The Girl Who Leapt Through Time
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Girl_Who_Leapt_Through_Time_(2006_film)). The film was fantastic. A nice mixture of action and drama. It had some small twists, but also played to a lot of classic tropes. The film's animation was gorgeous.

I read [The Rook](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12988330-the-rook) which was a fun little fantasy thriller. It's all about this secret agency in britain that deals with monsters and an agent who has lost all of her memories.

I read [The Descender, Vol. 1](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25546167-descender-vol-1) at the recommendation of @samantha_gold. It's a beautiful comic. I'm really looking forward to the next issue later this year, because I really want to see where this world goes.

I listened to the first two episodes of the [Hacked Podcast](http://www.hackedpodcast.com/). It's a nice attempt at covering computer and information security. I'm not sure how understandable it is to the general population, but I liked it as a simplified version of the big concerns in security today.

[Morgan Freeman Dramatically Reads Justin Bieber's 'Love Yourself'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRKZh-2j4PY&feature=youtu.be) was just fun.

I use a lot of Ruby HTTP libraries, so I really liked @jvns's [Surprises in Ruby HTTP libraries](http://jvns.ca/blog/2016/03/04/whats-up-with-ruby-http-libraries/). It wasn't actually surprising as someone who has used all of these libraries at least once, but it was an interesting reminder of how the ruby community tends to build ten pieces of software that are all quite similar, and then @geemus is off in a corner just writing cool unique stuff.

@holman's [How to Deploy Software](https://zachholman.com/posts/deploying-software) has been a great read. It's given me a lot to think about, and also solidified some of my opinions on the topic.

I was featured on [Nine reflections on RC](https://www.recurse.com/blog/102-nine-reflections-on-rc), which caused me to go and reread a bunch of people's articles about Recurse Center, which is always nice.

Anyways, have a great week!
