I didn't know Zuckerberg did a challenge a year. I really like the idea. Focusing on broadening perspectives is pretty neat.

His past challenges are pretty neat, purely on the level of frequency.

```
- Learning to speak Mandarin
- Meeting one new person who doesn't work at Facebook everyday
- Writing a thank you note each day to someone who made the world better
- Being a vegetarian (or only eating meat if I killed the animal myself)
- Wearing a tie every day
```
