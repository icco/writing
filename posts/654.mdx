So... it's been five weeks since I last wrote one of these... my shame is great. I've been sick, and I also was traveling for a bit, so I guess that's a valid excuse? Not really... but #shrugs.

Here is what's been making me #happy this week!

[What Kind Of Idiot Gets Phished?](http://pca.st/utEk) is a fun podcast exploration into phishing and the psychology behind it.

[The Media's Best-Kept Secret Was A Free Wall Street Journal Login, And Now It's Gone](https://www.buzzfeed.com/matthewzeitlin/rip-media-media) is fascinating. I'm not surprised it existed, but man I would love a post-mortem from the WSJ.

[A Year of Google Maps & Apple Maps](https://www.justinobeirne.com/a-year-of-google-maps-and-apple-maps) by @justinobeirne is a fascinating read on design changes over time.

This advice I think only makes sense for a certain type of person, but it's interesting: [Building a startup? Build an audience, first.](https://medium.com/@rrhoover/building-a-startup-build-an-audience-first-9fbba4f1fa15?source=ifttt--------------1) by @rrhoover.

[Storytelling Should Be the Number One Skill You Want to Improve](https://themission.co/storytelling-should-be-the-number-one-skill-you-want-to-improve-746c5e7c8afe?source=ifttt--------------1) is valid advice, although the article itself is kind of weak.

[Club Abstract](https://play.google.com/music/r/m/Luytloialhv2zpks2bwekwmlr4y?t=Club_Abstract) on Google Play Music is my new favorite radio station. Been working to it all week!

There is nothing worthwhile in Forbes [Odds And Winning Predictions For Golden State Warriors Vs. Cleveland Cavaliers](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkay/2017/05/25/2017-nba-finals-odds-and-winning-predictions-for-golden-state-warriors-vs-cleveland-cavaliers/#7862bfbf7ef7), but hey, anything that says the Warriors will win is ok in my book.

[Someone is using other people's names to file ant-net-neutrality posts to the FCC](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/05/25/somebody-impersonated-these-people-to-criticize-the-fccs-net-neutrality-rules-now-the-victims-are-demanding-answers/). My general thought is Russia, but that's now my scapegoat for all internet shenanigans, which they definitely don't hold a monopoly on.

[Jeffrey Gettleman](http://pca.st/DM6Z) on the Longform Podcast is an amazing interview. His life makes my life seem so boring.

This weeks tech drama piece: [Chrome won](https://andreasgal.com/2017/05/25/chrome-won/), by the former CTO of Mozilla.

In posts that I read because the headline pun was amazing: [Take a Load Off. The Robots That Fold Laundry Are Coming.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/24/business/entrepreneurship-laundroid-self-folding-laundry-machine.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=mini-moth&region=top-stories-below&WT.nav=top-stories-below)

[At His Own Wake, Celebrating Life and the Gift of Death](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/25/world/canada/euthanasia-bill-john-shields-death.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=photo-spot-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&_r=0) is a beautiful article about life and death.

I've been told that if you want to work at the intersection of tech and politics, you need to read [So you want to reform democracy](https://medium.com/civic-tech-thoughts-from-joshdata/so-you-want-to-reform-democracy-7f3b1ef10597?source=ifttt--------------1). I'm not sure if I agree, but it's an interesting read.

[How to Build a Robust Scheduled Task Service in AWS Using Cloudwatch, Lambda, DynamoDB and ECS](https://www.fin.com/eng-blog/how-to-build-a-robust-scheduled-task-service-in-aws-using-cloudwatch-lambda-dynamodb-ecs) is a fun thing to think about, and a reminder that every company reinvents scheduled workers for some reason.

[OnePassword Travel Mode: Protect your data when crossing borders](https://blog.agilebits.com/2017/05/18/introducing-travel-mode-protect-your-data-when-crossing-borders/) is a thing that is useful if you use OnePassword (which I switched to from LastPass a few months ago).

A review of Hasan Minhaj's Netflix Standup special: [The Daily Showâ€™s Hasan Minhaj crafts a hilarious, spellbinding immigrant story](http://www.avclub.com/review/daily-shows-hasan-minhaj-crafts-hilarious-spellbin-255697). You should watch the special if you can. As someone on Facebook put it, "72 minutes of every single emotion".

In TIL: [Linux utils that you might not know](http://shiroyasha.io/coreutils-that-you-might-not-know.html) by @igor_sarcevic.

[Overtime with Kelli Anderson](http://pca.st/Vp6N) is just a fun interview with an artist.

I've been wanting to do this for a while: [A month of breaking news alerts, visualized](https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/politics/wp/2017/05/18/a-month-of-breaking-news-alerts-visualized/)

I spent a decent amount of time over the last two weeks playing with [influxdata/TICK-docker](https://github.com/influxdata/TICK-docker). The TICK stack is my new favorite open source monitoring tool. We'll see how long that lasts.

Anyways, have a great week!
