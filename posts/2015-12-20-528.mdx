Ok, what's making me #happy? Let's think about this for a second...

Well, as a believer in [Kopimism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missionary_Church_of_Kopimism), this article about [Peter Sunde building The Ultimate Piracy Machine](https://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bay-founder-builds-the-ultimate-piracy-machine-151219/) made me pretty ecstatic. Probably the best art piece explaining why the RIAA is wrong so far.

Speaking of music and art, [10x15](http://www.10x2015.com/) is out. It's a yearly project where a bunch of designers make album art for their favorite ten albums of the year.

Oh, and music wise, I've been listening to a lot of [Nujabes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nujabes) and [DJ Sprinkles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terre_Thaemlitz). 

Continuing the Conan video I linked [last week](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/426), I've been watching these videos where Conan interacts with his coworkers, which are just amazing.

 - [Conan Hunts Down His Assistant's Stolen "Gigolos" Mug](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI8QZ2WN-Xo&feature=youtu.be)
 - [Conan Catches Jordan Schlansky Coming In Late](https://youtu.be/Auh74d_OG8Y)
 - [Conan Hangs Out With His Interns](https://youtu.be/ffVbnPjl86A)

Also in the late night television youtube wars, [Jimmy Fallon sings a "Star Wars" medley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTLAx3VDX7g&feature=youtu.be) is pretty fantastic if you like a capellas. Also, if you like rap, [Chance the Rapper's performance of "Somewhere in Paradise" on SNL](http://pitchfork.com/news/62515-chance-the-rapper-performs-somewhere-in-paradise-with-jeremih-on-saturday-night-live/) was pretty solid. Plus he's the first independent musical artist on SNL, so that's cool.

I seem to be on a Youtube kick, so I guess I'll post two other videos I loved:

 - ["Just Me In The House By Myself" starring Macaulay Culkin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yh7-wAy_8ss&feature=youtu.be)
 - [Kelly's Slater funded his own Wave Machine](https://vimeo.com/149396475)

In the tech world, I read [It's Still the Data, Stupid!](https://blog.shodan.io/its-still-the-data-stupid/), which was a good reminder that you should secure your internet services. I was introduced to [Scout2](https://github.com/iSECPartners/Scout2) this week, and if you run on AWS, you should run it and realize how insecure you are. 

@stratus also posted the [draft Go 1.6 release notes](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.6), which led me to a nice blog post informing me that [Go is now six years old](https://blog.golang.org/6years) which is kind of mind blowing.

My holiday vacation has started, so I'm gonna get back to [coding](https://github.com/icco?tab=activity), learning to cook [Tamagoyaki](http://www.justonecookbook.com/tamagoyaki-japanese-rolled-omelette/), and reading [Best Of articles](https://pinboard.in/t:bestof).

Have a good one!
