Lets start with the important detail, I had food from [Dosa Man](http://mashable.com/2014/10/19/dosa-man-food-cart-nyc/) for lunch. So good. Would recommend.
 
Ok, now for the Recurse Center stuff:
 
This week I joined a checkin group focused on gaming and graphics. The group consisted of [Nikki](https://twitter.com/mno00), [Chris](https://twitter.com/dy_dx_), [Aishwarya](aishwarya923), [Libby](https://twitter.com/horrorcheck), [Luna](https://twitter.com/lunacodess) and Olivia. The group mentioned two game jams to look into, [Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com/compo/) and [Adventure Jam](http://jams.gamejolt.io/adventurejam). Nikki also reminded me I wanted to look into the project she was working on and presented last week, [Text-Rearranger](https://github.com/nikkisquared/Text-Rearranger).
 
I started researching Javascript based game development. I came across a bunch of Javascript graphics libraries that could be useful:

 - http://threejs.org/
 - http://www.createjs.com/
 - http://paperjs.org/
 - http://fabricjs.com/
 - http://canvasjs.com/

I started reading [Designing Games](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16144499-designing-games), because I couldn't find a book specifically on Javascript game development I wanted to read, so instead went super general. I did come across [The Web Game Developers Cookbook](http://www.amazon.com/The-Web-Game-Developers-Cookbook/dp/0321898389/) which had a lot of good project ideas in its description:

  -   Mastering an essential HTML5/JavaScript game development toolset: browser, text editor, terminal,  JavaScript console, game engine, and more
  -   Accelerating development with external libraries and proven patterns
  -   Managing browser differences between IE, Firefox, and Chrome
  -   Getting up to speed on web development with a QUIZ game built with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and JQuery
  -   Creating INTERACTIVE FICTION “gamebooks” that leverage new CSS3 features and impress.js
  -   Building PARTY games around the lightweight atom.js engine
  -   Developing PUZZLE games with the easel.js graphics rendering engine
  -   Writing PLATFORMERS with melon.js and its integrated tilemap editor
  -   Coding intense 2-player FIGHTING games for web browsers with game.js
  -   Building a SPACE SHOOTER with the jQuery-based gameQuery game engine
  -   Implementing pseudo-3D techniques like ray casting for an FPS (First Person Shooter) style game
  -   Producing a 16 bit RPG (Role Playing Game) complete with interfaces for dialog, inventories,  and turn-based battles with enchant.js
  -   Building an isometric RTS (Real Time Strategy) game that incorporates server components along with  node.js, socket.io, and crafty.js
  -   Engaging players with content that encourages exploration

But I decided I wanted to write my first game by myself with no framework. I'm [making a replica](https://github.com/icco/life) of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life), and so I did some reading on [Bitmaps](http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/bitmaps/), [various life patterns](http://fano.ics.uci.edu/ca/rules/b3s23/), [implementation suggestions](http://dotat.at/prog/life/life.html) and read through [one possible implementation in C](http://dotat.at/cgi/cvsweb/things/life.c?rev=1.8). I then just started reading the [Mozilla Canvas Tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial).

I didn't get too far before I headed over to our Monday night talk which was titled "Software: An Ethereal Dreamscape of Adventure and Possibility" by @pchiusano. It was an interesting look into what he thought was wrong with software development today, and he gave a high level overview of his [Unison Project](http://pchiusano.io/unison).

Unrelated, I am sad I didn't get to see the [Snowden Bust](http://animalnewyork.com/2015/theres-a-massive-illicit-bust-of-edward-snowden-stuck-to-a-war-monument-in-brooklyn/) before it was [torn down](https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/6/8353549/edward-snowden-sculpture-fort-greene-park-brooklyn-new-york).
