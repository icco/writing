I slept in! It was glorius.

I finally fixed http://code.natwelch.com, which had been broken because I was too aggresively caching the homepage.

I read through the RC Companies list, and came across ones that might be interesting. Like I said [on Saturday](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/127), these are purely investigated based on interestingness, not based on location or available positions.

I also checked out [Kickstarter's Job page](https://web.archive.org/web/20160415202537/https://www.kickstarter.com/jobs/software_engineer), which sounded interesting. I checked it out after reading [a NYT article on failed projects](https://web.archive.org/web/20240221184314/https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/03/magazine/zpm-espresso-and-the-rage-of-the-jilted-crowdfunder.html).

In the afternoon, I went and saw [The Bjork Exhibit at the MOMA](https://web.archive.org/web/20231202211008/https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/06/arts/design/review-bjork-unfurled-in-many-guises-at-moma.html). The audio portions were amazing, as were the costumes, but it was a little short.

I had burgers and beer with Aaron and Kristen, watched Game of Thrones, and then went to sleep.
