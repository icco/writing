I made some progress on #tenbysix this week. Not as much as I would have liked due to [!!con](http://bangbangcon.com/), but some.

## Stuff I worked on this week:

I got [enki.garden](https://github.com/icco/enki.garden) building on Travis CI. I started playing around with the golang database/sql package.

I put together a Raspberry Pi for [locative.garden](https://github.com/icco/locative.garden).

I wrote more of [Gandalf](https://github.com/icco/gandalf).
