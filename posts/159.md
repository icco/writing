Arrived in NYC at 7am, took a cab home, passed out in my bed.

I finally made it into RC around 1500. I dicked around on the internet for a little bit, and then talked to [Sophie](https://sfrapoport.github.io/) about how to attempt to reverse engineer web services. We ended up going down an interesting rabbit hole comparing how different news organizations do Live Streams, since we had the WWDC 2015 keynote going on.

We compared [The Verge](http://live.theverge.com/apple-wwdc-2015-liveblog/) and [ArsTechnica](http://live.arstechnica.com/apples-wwdc-2015-keynote-liveblog/). Ars's made a lot of sense, as it was just a simple JSON poll for all events to display. Verge was doing this weird thing where they were writing the entire page into S3 every three seconds. It confused us, but then we found [a blog post describing Verge's Live Blog system](http://product.voxmedia.com/2012/6/15/5426782/introducing-syllabus-vox-medias-s3-powered-liveblog-platform).

In the evening I want to the Monday night talk, this week by [Allison Parrish](http://www.decontextualize.com/). I need to ask her for slides, it was a pretty inspiring talk on cool things you can build combining art and technology, specifically as it relates to the written word.

Totally unrelated:

 - [Running Your Own Anonymous Rotating Proxies](http://blog.databigbang.com/running-your-own-anonymous-rotating-proxies/) sounds cool.
 - [INTRODUCTIONS](https://vimeo.com/125095515) is entertaining video from a performance #art standpoint.
