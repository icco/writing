I was playing around with the new https://beta.fec.gov and found that it was pretty easy to get a bunch of data about who is donating to what. So I wrote [a little script](https://github.com/icco/influence) to download the data and figure out how much Google employees were donating to political campaigns from January 1st, 2015 until now.

The top 10:

* RO FOR CONGRESS INC.: $9,400
* LOFGREN FOR CONGRESS: $12,175
* WYDEN FOR SENATE: $12,700
* LESSIG2016\.US: $21,210
* NRSC: $33,400
* DCCC: $33,620
* DSCC: $34,700
* FRIENDS OF SCHUMER: $43,600
* BERNIE 2016: $47,121
* HILLARY FOR AMERICA: $105,089
* GOOGLE INC. NETPAC: $242,489


I'm not 100% sure this is correct. I'm wondering if this is double counting stuff some how. You can see the data that I'm [working with on beta.fec.gov](https://beta.fec.gov/data/receipts/?is_individual=true&contributor_employer=Google&min_date=01-01-2015&max_date=12-31-2016) or in [the json file I saved to github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/icco/influence/master/data.json).

**Update**: I [reran these numbers in April](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/571). The above numbers were a little low.

Also, full disclosure, I am an employee of Hillary For America. That being said, this was done in my free time and purely out of curiosity, and not part of my day to day job.
