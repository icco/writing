I wanted to get one more #happy post out before the year ended. There's some especially happy news that will have to wait till later, so I'll just stick to internet things for now.

First off, I watched two TV shows over the last week: [Made in Abyss](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=18952) and [The Crown Season 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown_(TV_series)). I really enjoyed them both.

If you're caught up with The Crown, I really enjoyed their episode recaps, especially these two:

* [One, two princes kneel before you as The Crown sings the British boarding school blues](https://www.avclub.com/one-two-princes-kneel-before-you-as-the-crown-sings-th-1821555465)
* [The Crown grapples with faith, forgiveness, and secret Nazism](https://www.avclub.com/the-crown-grapples-with-faith-forgiveness-and-secret-1821278256)

I'm also very slowly playing through Nier: Automata on the PS4 and loving it. [Wired's review capture my feels about it pretty well](https://www.wired.com/story/nier-automata-game-of-the-year/). [The Kotaku review](https://kotaku.com/nier-automata-the-kotaku-review-1793002839) was also good.

Speaking of video games, I enjoyed [The 50 best games of 2017](https://www.polygon.com/2017-best-games/2017/12/18/16781674/best-video-games-2017-top-50-mario-pubg-zelda) by Polygon. Also, their [Ranking the numbered Final Fantasy games](https://www.polygon.com/features/2017/12/19/16793294/ranking-the-numbered-final-fantasy-games) was great.

[The rise, fall and return of Dance Dance Revolution in America](https://www.polygon.com/features/2017/12/11/16290772/the-rise-fall-and-return-of-dance-dance-revolution-in-america) has a great video, really moving story about people who are really good at DDR.

If we're talking about Best Of lists, check out [All of io9's 2017 Year in Review Lists in One Convenient Location](https://io9.gizmodo.com/all-of-io9s-2017-year-in-review-lists-in-one-convenient-1821627784?rev=1514569534979).

I'm writing my 2017 Year in Review, and came across some similar posts:

* [I do a yearly review, here are some of the questions](https://medium.com/@skamille/i-do-a-yearly-review-here-are-some-of-the-questions-cd23e19795e1?source=ifttt--------------1)
* [Reading more](https://paulstamatiou.com/reading-more-kindle-oasis/)
* [60 Days of Yoga](https://medium.com/habit-of-introspection/60-days-of-yoga-2088496b415f?source=ifttt--------------1)

I had never seen the [Standard Go Project Layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout) before, but as I'm writing more and more Go, it was a nice doc to read.

[Must This Baby Otter Learn to Swim?](http://amp.slate.com/articles/video/did_you_see_this/2017/12/a_baby_otter_would_prefer_not_to_learn_to_swim.html?__twitter_impression=true) is really really cute.

[The reason every meme uses that one font](https://www.vox.com/2015/7/26/9036993/meme-font-impact) is interesting. I never knew the history.

[A year in charts: From bitcoin to Trump and chess playing robots](https://www.ft.com/content/7020a6e4-e4e3-11e7-8b99-0191e45377ec)

[17 Solid NYC Restaurants With Fireplaces](https://ny.eater.com/maps/best-restaurants-fireplaces-nyc) made me excited to get back to NY. I wanna stalk down all of these.

[A Single Div](http://a.singlediv.com/) is beautiful and amazing. The art here is incredible.

I've always hoped this would happen in California, but it hasn't. Shoutout to Germany: [Power Prices Go Negative in Germany](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/25/business/energy-environment/germany-electricity-negative-prices.html)

[Computer latency: 1977-2017](https://danluu.com/input-lag/) is fascinating by @danluu.

[Google Container Registry Vulnerability Scanning](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/vulnerability-scanning) is such a neat beta from Google. I started playing with it, but got distracted like usual.

[New York's vanishing shops and storefronts: 'It's not Amazon, it's rent'](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/24/new-york-retail-shops-amazon-rent) - least surprising article I've read in a while.

I feel like that's a bad place to end the last happy post of 2017... so I'll leave you with my favorite Gif of 2016.
