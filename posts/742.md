Everything is ok. This is a bit of a mantra for me. If you live on the internet, reading this you'll probably think I have got a few screws loose. There's so many things wrong: the economy, wars, death, destruction, the planet is dying, rights are being stripped away, etc.

Horrible things are happening. This is true.
