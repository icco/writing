Hello everyone! A #happy post for your Sunday.

As @markgius put it, "now there are think-pieces on it, this shit moves so fast now": [Why that “distracted boyfriend” stock photo meme is suddenly everywhere](https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/8/25/16200526/distracted-boyfriend-other-woman-stock-photo-meme)

Reddit's [r/datahoarder](https://reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/) is one of my favorite subreddits. It was featured in a Vice article this week: [A Redditor Archived Nearly 2 Million Gigabytes of Porn to Test Amazon’s ‘Unlimited’ Cloud Storage](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/a33j5a/a-redditor-archived-nearly-2-million-gigabytes-of-porn-to-test-amazons-unlimited-cloud-storage).

The sub has a lot of interesting work going on and is essentially a union of the people who work on [ArchiveTeam](http://www.archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) and those who enjoy [r/serverporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/ServerPorn/). If this group makes no sense to you, this quote highlights their deep belief:

Speaking of old things, I enjoyed @gc's [The Beginning of Uber](https://medium.com/@gc/the-beginning-of-uber-7fb17e544851?source=ifttt--------------1), where he showed Uber's original pitch deck. From there I went and [read through this random list of startup pitch decks](http://onboardly.com/startup-pr/best-startup-pitch-decks-of-all-time/). History is fascinating. 

[Billionaire Porn King Reinvents Himself as Japan’s Startup Guru](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-23/billionaire-porn-king-reinvents-himself-as-japan-s-startup-guru)
 was interesting, and after all this startup stuff, I ended up on [YC Summer 2017 Stats](https://blog.ycombinator.com/yc-summer-2017-stats/), because I guess reading about tech startups always brings you back to YC. 

And you can't talk about startups right now and not mention ICOs, so "[IPFS, CoinList, and the Filecoin ICO with Juan Benet and Dalton Caldwell](https://blog.ycombinator.com/ipfs-coinlist-and-the-filecoin-ico-with-juan-benet-and-dalton-caldwell/)".

Also short and historical, I enjoyed "[Always Idlewild](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/08/23/nyregion/metropolitan-diary-always-idlewild.html?_r=0&referer=https://t.co/EvwRZ0isLg?amp=1)" from the NYT, and I like the name Idlewild.

Last oldish thing, I promise. I'm working on a talk for Strange Loop, and so I rewatched @mikeydickerson's talk [Velocity NY 2014 Keynote: "One Year After healthcare.gov..."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Vc8sxhy2I4&feature=youtu.be) which is still great and inspiring. I also found Github's [Exception Monitoring and Response](https://githubengineering.com/exception-monitoring-and-response/) article fascinating while doing talk research.

I listened to three fantastic episodes of [The Eater Upsell](https://www.eater.com/upsell). Thanks to @markgius for the recommendation.

 - [(Ep 28) Anthony Bourdain Is Living the Dream](http://pca.st/WnyA)
 - [(Ep 54) David Chang: "Almost everything we've done has been a failure from the get-go"](http://pca.st/rs4f)
 - [(Ep 63) The Relationship Between Wall Street Money and NYC Restaurants (Billions Creator Brian Koppelman)](http://pca.st/e5g9)

Also in great listening, check out [DJ Premier's Tiny Desk Concert](http://www.npr.org/event/music/543717146/dj-premier-the-badder-band-tiny-desk-concert).

There is a slightly more disturbing video, that's still quite funny, in [Crosswalk the Musical: Hair w/ Lin-Manuel Miranda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJd0-sRffFE&feature=youtu.be). 

[Offline Only](https://chris.bolin.co/offline/) is neat. I tried building an offline cash register web app a few years ago, and it really looks like the tech is a lot better now for dealing with offline data storage.

Two excellent @recursecenter end of batch posts:

 - @indradhanush92's  [Recurse Center - Never Graduate!](https://indradhanush.github.io/blog/recurse-center-never-graduate/)
 - @jaseemabid's [What did I do at Recurse Center?](https://jaseemabid.github.io/2017/08/10/rc.html)

To close on a fun note. I finally watched [Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol._2). It was decent, but I really enjoyed ion9's [Let's Break Down All Five of the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 End-Credits Scenes](https://io9.gizmodo.com/lets-break-down-all-five-of-the-guardians-of-the-galaxy-1794956328).

Have a great week!
