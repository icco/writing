What's this? My favorite Genre, Author, and state of mind, all in one post? Hurrah!

Ok, I discovered a wonderful thing last year, right before the infamous wipe of my archives. This wonderful thing was a new Gibson book. I was so happy in my discovery I created <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spook_Country&amp;oldid=80331232">a Wikipedia post on it</a>,  and then forgot about it. Right before <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0545010225?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=pseudoweb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0545010225">Harry Potter</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=pseudoweb-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0545010225" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important" border="0" height="1" width="1" /> premiered, I checked up on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spook_Country">the article</a>, only to find it was coming out a few days later. Huzzah!

But at the same time I had started my internship at Adobe, and thus it slipped again from my memory. Thankfully though,  <a href="http://binarybonsai.com/" title="who writes a great blog, btw">Michael Heilemann</a> showed me the light, when I stumbled  <a href="http://binarybonsai.com/archives/2007/07/25/gibson-on/">across his post</a>.  Praise the gods, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0399154302?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=pseudoweb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0399154302">Spook Country</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=pseudoweb-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0399154302" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important" border="0" height="1" width="1" /> has been released and I will be going to buy it tomorrow.<!--more-->

So yes, That is my first piece of consumerwhoreism. Also tomorrow I will in theory be ordering my new computer, and possibly picking up some manga. Basically I will be left overjoyed, and my bank account will be crying like a rape victim.

But enough of my bad analogies and metaphors. If you haven't read any of Gibson's work, I highly recommend his writing. The best three books that he has written so far I believe are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0441569595?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=pseudoweb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0441569595">Neuromancer</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=pseudoweb-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0441569595" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important" border="0" height="1" width="1" />, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060539828?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=pseudoweb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0060539828">Burning Chrome</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=pseudoweb-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0060539828" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important" border="0" height="1" width="1" />, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0425198685?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=pseudoweb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0425198685">Pattern Recognition</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=pseudoweb-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0425198685" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important" border="0" height="1" width="1" />.

In other news, my server is running like a drunk fat twelve year old. Needless to say, all of my sites are suffering from his choice to break the law and drink. No alcohol on the job kid!

p.s. I never did mention this but I read and loved the latest Harry Potter. I have a half written post just sitting here as a review, but meh, Just go read it yourself.
