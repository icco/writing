Got the general content of my Code Words article done and @staringispolite gave me a bunch of good advice on how to make it better. Gotta think about that and try and get a little more structure into my post.

Also took the train back from Philly. That was very pleasant, such an easy train ride. I wish I wasn't so exhausted though.
