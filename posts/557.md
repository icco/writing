I finished watching the first season of [Magi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magi:_The_Labyrinth_of_Magic). It's been a little more childish than I expected, but overall I've enjoyed it.


I played through [Firewatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewatch_(video_game)). The game was beautiful and sad, although a little short.

I've been jamming on [808 State's Pacific State](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jQ_bOP0HfY&feature=youtu.be).

I really liked the idea behind the [Make Time Clock](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/chapambrose/make-time-clock-get-serious-about-side-projects/description), although I didn't invest in it.

I also finally finished listening to some episodes of [Design Details](http://spec.fm/podcasts/design-details). Three of my favorite designers (all of whom @alexbaldwin introduced me to) have great interviews that are all intertwined:

 - @mrmrs_: http://spec.fm/podcasts/design-details/16190
 - @jxnblk: http://spec.fm/podcasts/design-details/19537
 - @jongold: http://spec.fm/podcasts/design-details/14150

Finally [Jay Pharaoh on Katt Williams and Kevin Hart's Feud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAm-bozvvdI&feature=youtu.be) was hilarious.

Have a great week!
