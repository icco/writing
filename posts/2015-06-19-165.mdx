Thursday was kind of nuts.

In the morning I got in kind of late, but committed to two things next week: helping Steve learn about [Go HTML templates](https://golang.org/pkg/html/template/) and helping Kamal learn about prototyping websites quickly with CSS.

I went for a quick lunch and then went off for an interview at [LittleBits](http://littlebits.cc/). That went really well. It was supposed to be 30 minutes, and I ended up talking to people for a little over three hours (for personal record I talked to [Josh](https://twitter.com/heavypennies), [Joe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joeneal) and [Jenny](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/jenny-lawton/10/784/92)).

After that, I took a slow walk south from their office at [26th and 11th](https://goo.gl/maps/yF3y2) down to the [Judd House](http://www.juddfoundation.org/new_york) at the corner of [Spring and Mercer](https://goo.gl/maps/hhY4I).

This place was utterly amazing. One of the most beautiful living spaces I have ever seen. Sadly there were no photos allowed inside, but I got some of the @onuniverse folks and @josephcohen whom I tagged along with to see this beautiful place.

Afterwards, we grab some beers and chatted. Then I went back to RC where some wine was drank, then a bunch of us grabbed delicious Indian food, and then more wine was drank.
