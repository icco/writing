I'm on holiday, so I'm generally pretty #happy, but the following things helped a bit.

First off, I listened to three great episodes of [the Longform Podcast](https://longform.org/podcast): [Alex Blumberg](https://longform.org/posts/longform-podcast-124-alex-blumberg), [Doug McGray](https://longform.org/posts/longform-podcast-173-doug-mcgray) and [Paul Ford](https://longform.org/posts/longform-podcast-5-paul-ford). All three were interesting episodes. Blumberg's talked about his experiences before starting [Gimlet Media](https://gimletmedia.com/), Ford's talked about his carreer stradeling both writing and tech, and McGray's was just generally inspiring about growing a small passion project to a much bigger thing.

I got back into my obsession with [Mini Metro](http://dinopoloclub.com/minimetro/). The web version isn't too great, but the steam game is incredibly addictive. It's best played, in my opinion, on fast forward.

I also finally watched [Ant-Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant-Man_(film)). It's so good! The end is a little drawn out, but I'm saddened I didn't see it in theaters. It's funny, a good action film, and has a nice heartwarming story.

[Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rage_of_Bahamut:_Genesis) has been entertaining me as well. I found out about it from [this fantastic anime recommendation chart](https://imgur.com/q9Xjv4p). The anime is decent, but the chart is the real winner here. Thanks to @_suspi for sharing it.

I hope you're having a happy holidays. It's been snowing here, but there have also been some gorgeously clear days.
