Whee, #happy Saturday!


Youtube often answers questions I have about the world, for instance, [Do Gay People Care About John Oliver?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFS1gwzTTs&feature=youtu.be)

I'm pretty excited for APFS to come out, so I'm excited that [iOS 10.3 will automatically upgrade your filesystem](https://arstechnica.com/apple/2017/01/ios-10-3-will-be-apples-first-update-to-convert-storage-to-apfs/), even though I don't have an iPhone.

I listened to two great [Longform](https://longform.org/podcast) episodes this week: [Ana Marie Cox](http://pca.st/ImDB) & [Alexis C. Madrigal](http://pca.st/zEgw).

I'm [Raising money for Journalism](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/642), please donate if you can.

[I Ignored Trump News for a Week. Hereâ€™s What I Learned](https://nyti.ms/2ludepa) was a good read.

I'm pretty excited about [Netflix Stethoscope](http://techblog.netflix.com/2017/02/introducing-netflix-stethoscope.html).

Cheers!
