I started today (Tuesday) off with a phone call with [Two Sigma](https://www.twosigma.com/). Not sure what to think about them yet, but they seem to be doing some interesting stuff.

Afterwards I was in kind of a funk, so went and got Thai food and started rereading [Snow Crash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash). Afterwards I got back to writing for my Code Words article.

In the evening, I took an Amtrak to Philladelphia for [my Uncle's funeral](http://www.haganfuneralhome.com/memsol.cgi?user_id=1578115) tomorrow.
