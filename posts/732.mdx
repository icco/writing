Ok, new year, new attempt at getting back on the #happy train. Some content I consumed and enjoyed this week:

 - Resumed my watching of [Komi-san](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=24369). This show continues to be one of the greatest feel-good anime. It's an interesting look at anxiety, with some wacky anime hijinks thrown in.
 - I saw [The Boy and The Heron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boy_and_the_Heron). Not Ghibli's best work, but beautiful art and an interesting allegory for grief.
 - Started this seasons anime of [Solo Leveling](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=26000) (action), [Frieren](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=26334) (feel good fantasy) and [The Apothecary Diaries](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=27141) (historical drama / comedy). All three look like they're going to have great seasons.
 - Continued [For All Mankind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_All_Mankind_(TV_series)). This show continues to be absolutely wild and some of the best Science Fiction on TV right now.
 - [Matt Mullenweg on the Tim Ferris show](https://tim.blog/2023/12/29/matt-mullenweg-2/) was a nice listen. Normally Tim Ferris drives me a bit up the wall, but I enjoyed this discussion.
 - Listened to a few great episodes of Longform [Evan Hughes](https://longform.org/player/longform-podcast-555-evan-hughes), [Craig Mod](https://longform.org/player/longform-podcast-559-craig-mod) and [Daisy Alito](https://longform.org/player/longform-podcast-562-daisy-alioto).
 - Also read the latest volume of [Saga](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29237226-saga-volume-11) which continues to be good, even if it's getting really weird.
 - I read [Blue Lock vol. 22](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/200089888-blue-lock-vol-22) which is getting really boring. It might be time to drop the series.

I'm not really keeping track of newsletters or blog posts I read anymore, that should go into my todo at some point this year. But for now, this is a good starting place.

Hope you all had a good week, happy 2024!
