Ok, so this post on #happy is super late... but I'll try to act as if it's still Saturday, and only include stuff from last week.

[This American Life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org) did a segment titled ["Poetry of Propaganda"](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/575/poetry-of-propaganda). I find propaganda really interesting and this radio show reminded me of all the different ways it can go. This episode actually caused me to go read about [the Smith\-Mundt Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithâ€“Mundt_Act) which legalized the use of certain types of propaganda by the US Government.


The New York Times has a fun article titled [52 Places to Go in 2016](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/01/07/travel/places-to-visit.html). I liked this mainly due to the fantastic use of gifs throughout the article, but also there were a lot of fun places to visit.

@jdherg shared [These 20 Movies Are Vying For Best Picture At The 2016 Oscars](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/best-picture-oscars-2016_568e6a92e4b0cad15e638593) with me. I'm really curious to hear which will win. There were lots of good movies this year that I just didn't see.

Polygon has a great look at [the games of 2016](http://www.polygon.com/a/2016-game-preview-100-games/introduction-and-video-special). Hilariously, the preface it with some games listed in their 2015 version of this article never shipped.

For some #music fun, check out [littledrummertoy](http://littledrummertoy.ableton.com/) by Ableton. It's a cool site.

The Atlantic's [An Economist's Guide to Tidying Your Apartment](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/05/an-economist-reads-marie-kondo/392921/?single_page=true) reminded me that I want to read [The Life\-Changing Magic of Tidying Up](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22318578-the-life-changing-magic-of-tidying-up). Maybe this year I'll actually get on that.

Have a good one\!
