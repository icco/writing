My personal site, [natwelch.com](https://natwelch.com), was running a really old version of [tachyons](http://tachyons.io/). So today I decided to fix it up. I haven't done the blog yet, since that'll take longer,  but one step at a time.

[Pull Request 11](https://github.com/icco/natwelch.com/pull/11) has the diff of what changed, but here it is in pictures.
