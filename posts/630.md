As a follow up to my post on [Let's Encrypt Certs on Heroku](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/619), here is how you update your certs when it's three months in and they are expiring.

```
$ sudo certbot certonly --manual -d www.giftionary.city -d giftionary.city
```

Host the files it tells you to, then run:

```
$ sudo heroku certs:update /etc/letsencrypt/live/giftionary.city/fullchain.pem /etc/letsencrypt/live/giftionary.city/privkey.pem
