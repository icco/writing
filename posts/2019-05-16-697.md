Good Morning, time for the third #japan #travellog.

Yesterday we attended our third AirBnB experience of the trip, [personal styling with Hiro](https://www.airbnb.com/experiences/1314)\!

Hiro was so much fun, we wandered Ginza and surrounding neighborhoods for two hours and found all sorts of amazing clothes and fashion. Hiro introduced us to brands and designers we had never heard of, and also gave us a taste of modern japanese culture. He also recommended some amazing soba for after our tour.

After lunch, we visited two brand stores, the Hello Kitty store in Ginza and the Pokemon Center DX in Nihonbashi. Both were fun, and it was cool to see local folks on their lunch break buying stuff for their kids interspersed with tourists eating up the brands.

We went back to the hotel and relaxed for a bit, and then had a delicious sushi dinner at [Sushi Gonpachi Nishi\-Azabu](https://gonpachi.jp/nishi-azabu/). The meal was a delicious omakase sushi meal, but most folks were there for the Izakaya downstairs. When we read reviews after we left, we found out the restaurant was "the location of former\-US President Bush and former\-Prime Minister Koizumi’s Izakaya Summit, and even more famously known for its scene in Quentin Tarantino’s 2004 film Kill Bill" which was kind of cool. The food was delicious, and our hotel got us a reservation, when there were a ton of people waiting when we got there, so it was a fun experience, without even knowing the history.

Today is our last full day in Tokyo, so we will probably take it easy and do some wandering.
