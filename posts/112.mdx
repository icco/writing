I came across [WLPPR](http://wlppr.co/) today, which has a lot of gorgeous iPhone wallpapers, many of which are similar to [Google Earth for Chrome New Tab](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/earth-view-from-google-ma/bhloflhklmhfpedakmangadcdofhnnoh?hl=en).

Seeing these two great links made me want to clean up [walls.natwelch.com](http://walls.natwelch.com/), but I haven't taken the time yet.

[Kanye tweeted](https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/590216488277016576) a different kind of wallpaper today though...
