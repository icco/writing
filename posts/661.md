I have meant to put together a post on what media I consume daily. It has changed a lot lately, so might as well now so I can compare later.

Every morning I try to do a few things:

 - Read the NYT [Morning Briefing](http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/morning-briefing)
 - Listen to NPR's [Up First](http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510318/up-first)

And then, depending on time and mood I also:
 
 - Read [Money Stuff](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/topics/money-stuff) by @matt_levine & Bloomberg
 - Listen to [The Daily](https://www.nytimes.com/podcasts/the-daily?_r=0) by NYT
 - Listen to NPR's [Business Story of the Day](http://www.npr.org/podcasts/381444906/business-story-of-the-day)

Hope that's interesting to you. [Hit me up on Twitter](https://twitter.com/icco) with links to media you consume every morning!
