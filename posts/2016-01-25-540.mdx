This week has been pretty crazy because I started working on [HFA](http://hillaryclinton.com). But despite that, I've had just enough time to find stuff to keep me #happy. Gotta keep consuming to be a good American, right?

First off, shout out to @mrmrs_ for his fantastic recommendation of [Alec Baldwin's Here's the Thing](https://www.wnyc.org/shows/heresthething/). It's a pretty solid podcast with lots of great interviews. So far, [his interview of Dan Rather](https://www.wnyc.org/story/htt-dan-rather/) has been my favorite.

Also put together by WNYC is "[Project Snowpiercer](https://www.wnyc.org/story/map-how-mta-could-operate-subways-big-snowstorm/)" which figures out how much of the NY subway can run in 40 inches of snow. Apropos given the snowstorm this weekend.

The New York Times wrote about how [Larry Page Is Still Innovator in Chief](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/24/technology/larry-page-google-founder-is-still-innovator-in-chief.html). This feels like a planted article, but it was a good read nonetheless. I've liked Larry since I first joined Google. I don't think he's a good leader, but definitely an inspiring mind.

I'm super excited that [The Classic Cyberpunk Novel Altered Carbon Is Becoming A Netflix Series](http://io9.gizmodo.com/the-classic-cyberpunk-novel-altered-carbon-is-becoming-1754048539).

And "[The top 30 books on Amazon based on links in Hacker News comments](http://ramiro.org/vis/hn-most-linked-books/)" is the most predictable list in computer science. So many books that people keep on their shelves but never read.

Finally, @ifosteve and I are working on #tenbysix. He posted [his ten projects](http://redlua.com/post/and-then-there-were-10/) this week as well.

Have a great week!
