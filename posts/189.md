Been rewatching [Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_Shell:_Stand_Alone_Complex) and reading [Accelerando](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerando_(novel)) and both have themes that are similar to what this wonderful article talks about. Human creativity and curiosity are largely what push us on, everything else will be automated, soon.
