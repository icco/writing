In my home, there is a pile of servers. It didn't used to be this big or complicated, but since buying a home, my situation has changed. I have more space, cheaper electricity, and better internet. I used to run everything off of a single Synology box. But with space comes growth.

The above is a rough diagram of the network of these systems.

## Glass

Glass is the newest and most powerful of the servers. It's a [MINISFORUM NPB6](https://amzn.to/3zQffXk). The main reason I got this was for the i7-13620H CPU, as it has great benchmarks with Plex and is relatively affordable.

Glass has an NFSv4 mount of Cask, and serves content to Plex users remotely. It doesn't do much else, but works great.

## Rope

Rope is the second newest. It is a NUC10, and runs internal services. It runs things like the [Servarr](https://wiki.servarr.com/) family of services, various crons, and other random things. Everything is managed by `docker compose` and many of the services have file mounts over NFSv4

## Cask

Cask is a QNAP NAS.
