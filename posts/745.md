In my home, there is a pile of servers. It didn't used to be this big or complicated, but since buying a home, my situation has changed. I have more space, cheaper electricity, and better internet.

    Plex-->Glass;
    HTTPS-->Storm;

    Rope-->Cask;
    Glass-->Cask;
```
The above is a rough diagram of the network of these systems.

## Glass

Glass is the newest and most powerful of the servers. It's a [MINISFORUM NPB6](https://amzn.to/3zQffXk). The main reason I got this was for the i7-13620H CPU, as it has great benchmarks with Plex and is relatively affordable.

Glass has an NFSv4 mount of Cask, and serves content to Plex users remotely.
