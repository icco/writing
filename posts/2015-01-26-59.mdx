Described as "a cinematic collage generated by p2p users" [THE PIRATE CINEMA](http://thepiratecinema.com/online/) is a really cool idea. [TorrentFreak](http://torrentfreak.com/pirate-cinema-visualizes-torrent-traffic-in-online-art-display-150125/)'s article on the art piece goes into the details of what it shows (and very high level of how it works). [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/67518774) has a video of the live exhibit as well. I want to build stuff like this. Art that combines a snapshot of reality, people's actions displayed in an unusual way.
