April was not a good month for writing. 

In [my last post](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/758) I net ~3k words in March. In April I net ~1k words. I can attribute this to two things: remaining very busy at work, and having my mom visit for two weeks.

Given in January I declared [I would be done writing in July](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/natwelch/make-100-locative-garden/posts/4302826), I really need to step it up.

I am currently at 14,225 words total. My guesstimate is that the final version will be 70,000. That's pretty daunting to realize how far behind I am. Let's do some rounding and say I need to write 55,000 words before July 1st, 2025. That's 54 days from now. That means I need to write a little over one thousand words a day. 

I also need to stop self-editing so much during writing. This is something I am pretty good at when writing non-fiction, but while writing fiction I find myself editing, deleting and revising constantly. This habit needs to stop. The goal should be words on page, as I have purposely scheduled editing time post July.

So my ask to you is to be annoying to me and hold me accountable for these 1k words a day. Text messages, DMs, sky writing, whatever would be appreciated. I will get this book to you all this year.

Lots of love from the east coast,

/Nat
