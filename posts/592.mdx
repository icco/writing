Ok, it's been a real long while, but lets try and do a #happy post. I'll try and not include a single article on US Politics, even though that's a large portion of my media intake these days.

While researching some implementation details for a website I'm thinking of building, I came across [queues.io](http://queues.io/), which is  just a long list of queue software, which is nice.

[Apple, Every Second](http://www.everysecond.io/apple/) is a cool visualization of all the money Apple is making every second. There is also one for [YouTube](http://www.everysecond.io/youtube/).

[Dan Deacon's "When I Was Done Dying"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuJqUvBj4rE&feature=youtu.be) from [Adult Swim's Off The Air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off_the_Air_(TV_series)). The video is pretty amazing, and a total trip. The TV show it was a part of is similar. 

[Mudge Is Grading Thousands of Programs For Vulnerabilities](https://theintercept.com/2016/07/29/a-famed-hacker-is-grading-thousands-of-programs-and-may-revolutionize-software-in-the-process/). This could be really cool if it works. So many developers don't understand security, and it's not an easy topic to learn about.

I enjoyed @pamasaur's [Thoughts on Cory Doctorowâ€™s Keynote at HOPE XI](http://thewebivore.com/thoughts-on-cory-doctorows-keynote-at-hope-xi/). One day I'll make it to HOPE or Defcon, but not this year.

Have a great day!
