This week had a lot of really good podcasts making me #happy.

 - [Simon Sinek](https://designobserver.com/feature/simon-sinek/39098/) on [Design Matters](http://www.debbiemillman.com/designmatters/). This was a fantastic interview about picking jobs and deciding where to go with your life.
 - [How To Make It (Quality)](https://wheretheressmoke.libsyn.com/how-to-make-it-quality) on [Where There's Smoke](https://www.wheretheressmoke.co/) was a great look at defining what is "Quality" and the work that goes into creating something of quality.
 - [Chris Sacca](http://foundation.bz/7/) on [Foundation](https://foundation.bz/) is an oldy but goody. My favorite part is @sacca talking about buying datacenters for Google, but the whole thing is pretty interesting.

Outside of Podcasts, I powered through [Armada](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16278318-armada), which I enjoyed, but was a little too sweet for me to recommend. I did start watching [The Man in the High Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_in_the_High_Castle_(TV_series)) which has been amazing so far.

On the internet, the video of  [Jimmy Fallon, Adele & The Roots Singing "Hello" with Classroom Instruments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yL7VP4-kP4&feature=youtu.be) is amazing and silly.

And @b0rk's great article on [Why you should understand a little about TCP](https://jvns.ca/blog/2015/11/21/why-you-should-understand-a-little-about-tcp/) is still something I'm sharing around a week later.

I hope you have a great week!
