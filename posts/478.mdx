I just read an amazing article on <a href="http://kotaku.com/">Kotaku </a>titled <a href="http://kotaku.com/5097355/i-gamer">"I,Gamer"</a>.

This article really spoke to me, because I find more often than not, I am more interested in the community behind a topic or trend then I do the actual topic/trend. It's not that I don't enjoy and love said topic, because otherwise I would never have initially gotten involved with the community.

Some examples of things this has happened:

Linux: first <a href="http://nblug.org/">NBLUG</a> then <a href="http://cplug.org/">CPLUG</a>

<a href="http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Gorgonnash&amp;n=Icco">World of WarCraft</a>: The diversity of people, guilds, and the forums. I'm more of a watcher of this community, mainly because I'm not nearly as hardcore as most, but I enjoy the culture non-the-less.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi_Knight_2">Jedi Knight II</a>: O how I loved this game, in fact it's probably the game that got me hooked on FPS, and I never beat it. Want to know what happened? I fell in love with <a href="http://thejediacademy.net/">The Jedi Academy</a>. This was an amazing place that promoted teaching others cool things in the game. In my mind it was basically a never ending online Bar Camp.

Web 2.0/Social Media: <a href="http://barcamp.org/">Bar Camps</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/icco">Twitter</a>, the whole community behind it. Here's to someday maybe getting invited to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo_Camp">FooCamp</a>.

<a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a>: This is what actually got me hooked on Web 2.0. Back when 1.2 hit I spent a lot of time on the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/forum/10">plugin forums</a> learning about <a href="http://php.net/">PHP</a> and helping others.

Case Modding/Computer Hardware: Let's not even talk about this. I was very active in a few communities, namely <a href="http://www.hardwaregeeks.com/">Hardware Geeks</a>, but I visited and posted on probably around 20 different forums and followed around 50 different blogs.

There have been a few other communities I've been active in, namely <a href="http://www.megatokyo.com/">MegaTokyo</a> and <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/">Penny-Arcade</a>,Â  but my involvement there is similar to my involvement to WoW. I follow what happens in the community, but I rarely participate.

Anyways, I'd like to end with a quote from the article:
<blockquote>"it's not because we're gamers. It's not even because we're hardcore gamers. It's because we're such fanatical culturalists that we forget about the middle ground."</blockquote>
