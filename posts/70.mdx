When I was working at @punchd, @helloxander \(and really the rest of the team\) turned me into a Kanye West addict. I already enjoyed his music at the time, but the team convinced me of his genius, or at least turned me onto the idea of deeply analyzing everything he does. As [Dave Chappelle said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4SYIfhzMmU) Kanye knows deep down, that he is dope, and has known this for a long time.

So most recently, Kanye released [YEEZY SEASON 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEYaLzRDyIA), which was announced previously with a countdown timer on [yeezy\.supply](http://yeezy.supply/) and [a trailer from Adidas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXOQrlx3EAM).

His actual launch show was pretty amazing, as it was mainly a show of light and fashion. Where a lot of Kanye's music lately has been loud and bright, this show was grey. Very minimal, and despite being "high fashion", it did feel like it was advertising the types of clothes you would wear in a relaxed urban setting.

It should be said though, that this was a very purposeful act, compared to his general life, as seen in a [recent Big Sean Show](http://pitchfork.com/news/58379-kanye-west-performs-calls-out-nike-during-big-sean-show/) or [at the Grammys](http://uk.businessinsider.com/grammys-taylor-swift-and-kanye-west-2015-2?r=US).


I'm really looking forward to reading the latest [33 1/3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/33â…“), which examines [Kanye West's My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy](http://www.bloomsbury.com/us/kanye-wests-my-beautiful-dark-twisted-fantasy-9781623565428/), which is his best album, in my opinion.
