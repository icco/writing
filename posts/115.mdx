Ken fixed a ton of bugs in Hyperspace, I refactored the JS a little. Not a productive Hyperspace day.

I chated with [Sonali](https://twitter.com/jollysonali) a little bit. Reminded me to think about the future a little. RC has a lot of cool companies it works with, but most are in NYC, which I'm not sure I'm ready to commit to, nor do I know the kind of gig I'd want... lots of thoughts to be had.

Listened to Mykola's [fantastic mixes from vyvn](https://soundcloud.com/muffs/sets/vyvn) pretty much on repeat all day. Sounds like [vyvn](http://vyvn.com/) is a pretty cool Burning Man camp, makes me want to get back out to the playa.

Did some research into things I might want to build for the [Soundscapes Hackathon](http://monthlymusichackathon.org/post/115585146087/soundscapes) on Saturday.
