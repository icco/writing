Lets see, today I worked on trying to get gene (my drum machine) working in a way that would render nicely on mobile. I didn't get very far though.

I took a nice long walk up to Washington Square Park and sat in the shade and listened to music for like an hour.

I revised my code words article on DDoS again to reflect some new edits from @nicholasbs.

I applied for a job at [LittleBits](http://littlebits.cc/careers).

I watched the Warriors game.
