Wow, I have totally fallen out of habit posting these. That being said, let's try and get a #happy post out right now. It's lunch time (kind of...), so lets list some links!

I enjoyed reading [How to Read More Books This Year](https://medium.com/the-mission/how-to-read-a-lot-more-books-this-year-according-to-harvard-research-e1dfc55e0b9f?source=ifttt--------------1). I felt great since I actually already do most of these things... except for the paper book thing. I'm a hardcore kindle convert.

@adactio talking about [Open source](https://adactio.com/journal/12080) is a nice meta-article. The promise of open source is pretty messed up when people don't help out.

[Sampha's Tiny Desk Concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnIu25lXXY8&feature=youtu.be) was great. So was [Delicate Steve's](http://www.npr.org/event/music/521234811/delicate-steve-tiny-desk-concert).

My new job doesn't use gmail, so I'm using Mail.app... so this article on [how to change the Mail.app Archive keyboard shortcut](http://crateofpenguins.com/blog/2013-10-how-to-change-the-mailapp-archive-keyboard-shortcut) was amazing. I missed being able to use `e` to get through my mail quickly.

[After 12 Rejections, Apple Accepts App That Tracks U.S. Drone Strikes](https://theintercept.com/2017/03/28/after-12-rejections-apple-accepts-app-that-tracks-u-s-drone-strikes/) was a great read. I've been following this story for a while, and was surprised to learn that I work with this guy now, which is cool.

[Sheelah Kolhatkar on Longform](https://longform.org/posts/longform-podcast-237-sheelah-kolhatkar) was an interesting dive on economics reporting, and also just a woman with a fascinating career. It was particularly good primer then for [Neural Networks and Suspicious Edge](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-03-28/neural-networks-and-suspicious-edge).

I'm starting to play with [beets music library](https://github.com/beetbox/beets) now that I've abandoned iTunes and still refuse to use most streaming services.

[The new 12-sided £1 Coin](https://www.thenewpoundcoin.com/) is really cool.

[The Subway](https://ryanriddle.github.io/subway.html) by @Rcriddler is a fun little programming project for optimizing a certain type of trip in NY.

I love the work @zeithq is doing [Next.js 2.0](https://zeit.co/blog/next2) sounds just as cool.

[The Handmaid's Tale Trailer](https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-handmaids-tale-trailer-shows-a-world-where-fear-bre-1793566930?rev=1490286319286) looks great. I haven't read this book since high-school, maybe it's time I reread it.

[Do you know how much your computer can do in a second?](https://computers-are-fast.github.io/) is a fun little game for programmer types.

[Bash quirks](https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/03/26/bash-quirks/) by @b0rk continues her series of amazingly informative blog posts on software.

[Modern JavaScript for Ancient Web Developers](https://trackchanges.postlight.com/modern-javascript-for-ancient-web-developers-58e7cae050f9?source=ifttt--------------1) was good advice for someone who is just joining a large javascript organization like I am. Thanks @ginatrapani.

[The Counterpointer III](http://www.luisapereira.net/projects/project/the-counterpointer-III/) is a neat synth.

[15 Five-Minute Breakfast Ideas That Aren't All Toast](http://www.bonappetit.com/story/five-minute-fast-breakfast-ideas?intcid=recirc_outbrain_mfooter) was a good list of breakfasts. I'm trying to get better at making breakfast, so lots of ideas in here. 

[Happy Birthday Wikipedia](https://medium.com/@monteiro/happy-birthday-wikipedia-c2f6f0c04f1b?source=ifttt--------------1) is a great article by @monteiro about my favorite online website. Also, his [Ethics can’t be a side hustle](https://deardesignstudent.com/ethics-cant-be-a-side-hustle-b9e78c090aee?source=ifttt--------------1) is also amazing if you haven't read it.

I love Drake, and I enjoyed @genius's [All The Samples & Production Credits For Drake's 'More Life'](https://genius.com/a/here-are-all-the-samples-production-credits-for-drake-s-more-life).

[Where It’s Made: The Times Newspaper](https://nyti.ms/2nvtA4j) scratches all of my infrastructure itches.


I didn't know what [Millennial Pink](http://nymag.com/thecut/2017/03/why-millennial-pink-refuses-to-go-away.html?mid=twitter_nymag) was. Now I know. Thanks internet.

I gave up early on in the Top Gear reboot, but The Verge has [Five reasons to give the new Top Gear a chance](http://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2017/3/17/14956692/top-gear-chris-harris-matt-leblanc-rory-reid-season-24). All it got me to do was to finish the last three episodes of [The Grand Tour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grand_Tour_(TV_series)), but I'm thinking about it now.

[the best art](http://nicole.pizza/the-best-art/) is an amazing project. I've tried making something like this a few times, and it always printed gibberish. I'm incredibly impressed by what @nicolehe has created, and the works she is creating after that. Great job!

I hadn't read most of the [Hacker koans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_koan) before today. Some of them are kind of neat.

Hope you have a great day!
