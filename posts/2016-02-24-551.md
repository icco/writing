Oi, I forgot to write my #happy post this weekend! Well here it is, three days late.

I've been really loving [Imprints' Data Trails](https://sereinlabel.bandcamp.com/album/data-trails). It's a great little EP.

@alexbaldwin introduced me to [automato farm](http://www.automato.farm/). They have some really cool projects that they have made.

[Wired did an article on the new Playboy magazine](http://www.wired.com/2016/02/nsfw-playboy-traded-nipples-for-good-design-and-it-works/). Interesting to see how internet culture is changing the world.

[Punctuation in novels](https://medium.com/@neuroecology/punctuation-in-novels-8f316d542ec4#.6f1iabhhz) is just a fun idea.

[The World OS](http://www.slideshare.net/fiahless1/the-world-os) is a fun slide deck looking into a possible future of AI.

I came across [Codacy](https://www.codacy.com/), and while I have no idea if it's any good, large scale static analysis on code is the thing I really miss from Google. We need to automate more things, especially in the code review world. It makes everything better.

If you're in NY, you should go see [Laura Poitras's Astro Noise](http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/LauraPoitras) at the Whitney. It's a short but a really well done exhibit.

If you haven't seen it, [Gravitational Waves Detected, Confirming Einstein’s Theory](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/12/science/ligo-gravitational-waves-black-holes-einstein.html) is incredibly exciting for science.

If you like videogames and e-sports, [Lupe Fiasco vs. the world's best Street Fighter player](http://www.polygon.com/2016/2/16/11014866/rapper-lupe-fiasco-beat-the-worlds-best-street-fighter-pro) is a fantastic watch. So silly, and so entertaining all at the same time.

And I'll end with this fun Kanye tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here is my Donda chart that I wrote 4 years ago that everyone laughed at… <a href="https://t.co/g1po6Z3H55">pic.twitter.com/g1po6Z3H55</a></p>&mdash; KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) <a href="https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/699108088687755264">February 15, 2016</a></blockquote>
