I spent the day working with Pam on finishing [ShhParty](https://github.com/pselle/shhparty). We got to the point where everything worked flawlessly. Next step is make it shiny.

Decided to take a break and enjoy the sun, so I went to a french restaurant down the street for happy hour. I ate french fries and drank beer while thinking about the future. Then I took a walk.

Simple day, but a good day. 80&deg;F today. Shorts weather!
