Ugh, totally failed at getting these out. But here's one more before the year is over. Some of these links are from recent, and some are from drafts I created but never published.

## Listening

 - [Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch](https://www.seafoodwatch.org) is celebrating their 25th anniversary and is putting out a list of the most sustainable fish, and recipes for them, with a new fish out every month: [The Super-Green Fish List](https://www.seafoodwatch.org/seafood-basics/sustainable-healthy-fish). I learned about this listening to [Short Wave: how to know if the seafood you're eating is sustainable](https://www.npr.org/2024/04/22/1198909886/sustainable-seafood-watch-tuna-responsible-fish).
 - [Money Can Buy You Everything, Except Maybe a Birkin Bag](https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2024/04/birkin-handbag-hermes-luxury-goods-lawsuit/678026/) from The Atlantic is a great dive into Hermes, the Birkin bag and a weird lawsuit happening in California. If you like the business of fashion, this is a great listen.

 - [Why We Bleep: Befaco](https://www.whywebleep.com/whywebleep/2024/befaco) does a great deep dive on how to run a super small business and the history of Befaco.

 - [Four Tet DJ Set](https://youtu.be/_cd5-NbEGmo?si=2Ueh1TyxNI30iGBf)

## Watching

 - [Sleater-Kinney: Tiny Desk Concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEyxy8S1MN8) is beautiful. I love their music, and in this setting they are wonderful.
