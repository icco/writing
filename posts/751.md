Ugh, totally failed at getting these out. But here's one more before the year is over. Some of these links are from recent, and some are from drafts I created but never published.

## Listening

 - [Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch](https://www.seafoodwatch.org) is celebrating their 25th anniversary and is putting out a list of the most sustainable fish, and recipes for them, with a new fish out every month: [The Super-Green Fish List](https://www.seafoodwatch.org/seafood-basics/sustainable-healthy-fish). I learned about this listening to [Short Wave: how to know if the seafood you're eating is sustainable](https://www.npr.org/2024/04/22/1198909886/sustainable-seafood-watch-tuna-responsible-fish).
 - [Money Can Buy You Everything, Except Maybe a Birkin Bag](https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2024/04/birkin-handbag-hermes-luxury-goods-lawsuit/678026/) from The Atlantic is a great dive into Hermes, the Birkin bag and a weird lawsuit happening in California. If you like the business of fashion, this is a great listen.

 - [Why We Bleep: Befaco](https://www.whywebleep.com/whywebleep/2024/befaco) does a great deep dive on how to run a super small business and the history of Befaco.
 - [Polk Award Winners: Brian Howey](https://longform.org/posts/polk-award-winners-brian-howey) taught me about an incredible story of messed up policing in California, my home state. Also was just a very interesting guy.
 - [Four Tet ‪@ TheLotRadio‬ 12-01-2024](https://youtu.be/_cd5-NbEGmo?si=2Ueh1TyxNI30iGBf) is great. I learned about this from a post on Mastodon that I can no longer find. Thanks to whomever recommended it!
 - [Fatboy Slim - Elevator Music](https://youtu.be/kTuLj0Nyhs4?si=XHv1wag8_YxRMyQc) is a high energy set. Just a fun time all around.

## Watching

 - [Sleater-Kinney: Tiny Desk Concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEyxy8S1MN8) is beautiful. I love their music, and in this setting they are wonderful.
 - A bunch of Anime, but [DandaDan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dandadan) is the one I want others to watch!
 - [Tottenham v. Manchester United](https://youtu.be/P8zCaj-xqdQ?si=8XqhQmY3aJLQixNk) has an amazing goal by Son, and has my team winning, so it's great. Yes, a lot of terrible goal keeping, but #shrugs.

## Reading

 - [Make resilient Go net/http servers using timeouts, deadlines and context cancellation](https://ieftimov.com/posts/make-resilient-golang-net-http-servers-using-timeouts-deadlines-context-cancellation/) taught me about how to set timeouts in Go, and also showed me I had a bug in almost all of my personal sites written in Go!
 - [The Ghosts in the Machine](https://harpers.org/archive/2025/01/the-ghosts-in-the-machine-liz-pelly-spotify-musicians/) and [The Ugly Truth About Spotify Is Finally Revealed](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/the-ugly-truth-about-spotify-is-finally) are incredibly depressing, about some sketchy stuff Spotify is doing to take even more advantage of musicians and artists.

## Playing

- [onedr0p/exportarr](https://github.com/onedr0p/exportarr) is a cool piece of software which scrapes a variety of Servarr type services and surfaces their data in a prometheus endpoint.
- I've been hooked on [Dragon Age: The Veilguard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Age:_The_Veilguard). It's got a lot of people complaining about it, but I'm loving the story telling. I particularly love how much of the story is hidden in side quests. I feel like I have to really search to understand what is happening, and am always rewarded for it.
