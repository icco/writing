I think this tweet summarizes most of my feelings. RC is set up so that there are always two active batches, one half-way through, and one just starting. Until today, I was in the early batch. Enjoying my six weeks as part of the newbie group. But Thursday was the last day of that. We wished the Spring 1, 2015 Batch a fairwell with a party in the park.

Before the farewell, Pam and I presented the project I had been working on with Pam and Cole, [ShhParty](https://github.com/pselle/shhparty). Our presentation went pretty well, it only had one small technical glitch.

Now for two weeks off (RC is having an Alumni week next week, and then closed for a week) and then back to the second half of RC.
