First #happy post of 2017. Here we go!

I am really enjoying the new albums by [The XX](http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22727-i-see-you/) and [Bonobo](http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22710-migration/). Both have been on repeat this past week, and have been quite enjoyable.

I read [How I got my attention back](https://backchannel.com/how-i-got-my-attention-back-c7fc9297d347) this morning. It's the third statement by people I respect (the other two being @fablednet and @mel_cantrell) telling me they had removed Twitter and Facebook from their phones. So I am removing both. I had actually uninstalled Facebook a while back, and Twitter I removed this morning. I hope this will get me back into journaling and writing on here. @craigmod's article really hit home. Not going extreme enough to block the domains on my laptop, but definitely trying to lower distractions.


ArsTechnica covered TASbot's crazy run from yesterday at [Games Done Quick](https://gamesdonequick.com/): [How a robot got Super Mario 64 and Portal “running” on an SNES](http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/01/how-a-robot-got-super-mario-64-and-portal-running-on-an-snes/). I highly recommend watching the video. It's a total trip.

[The Line of Death](https://textslashplain.com/2017/01/14/the-line-of-death/) is an interesting discussion on security and user-interfaces.

I couldn't stop laughing while reading [Please Stop Using Doughnuts as Sex Toys](http://www.extracrispy.com/culture/1886/please-stop-using-doughnuts-as-sex-toys). So hilarious!

[The A.V. Club's most anticipated games of 2017](http://www.avclub.com/article/press-start-continue-our-most-anticipated-games-20-248156) is a pretty indepth article talking about what is coming out in the world of video games in 2017.

[Obama Awards Biden Presidential Medal Of Freedom](http://www.npr.org/2017/01/12/509545778/in-surprise-send-off-president-obama-awards-biden-presidential-medal-of-freedom) brought many people I know to tears.

[Best Anime Movies Not Made by Studio Ghibli](https://www.tofugu.com/japan/best-anime-movies/) is a fantastic list of great anime films. I highly recommend all of these.

[Hacking an Election](http://pca.st/0PEB) by the [Hacked Podcast](https://www.hackedpodcast.com/) was an interesting listen, just because of how old it is, and how much things have changed since they put it out.

[The Kanye-thon](http://pca.st/Z83s) by the [Still Processing Podcast](https://www.nytimes.com/podcasts/still-processing?_r=0) is an amazing if you like Kanye. I missed a few of the things they talk about, and it was a fascinating look into the life of Kanye.


I still have [a strong love of time](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/177), so I was pretty excited that their [Stratum 1 Microserver HOWTO shipped](https://blog.ntpsec.org/2016/12/01/microserver-howto-is-official.html).

Anyways, I hope you're having a good new year, and I hope you have a great week.

Cheers,

/Nat
