I've got three podcast episodes of people talking about #creativity for you.

 - [Roy Horan](https://soundcloud.com/mikewalsh/roy-horan) on [Between Worlds](http://www.mike-walsh.com/betweenworlds)

 - [Joe Hollier](http://designobserver.com/feature/joe-hollier/39386) on [Design Matters](http://www.debbiemillman.com/designmatters/)

 - [David Kelley](https://creativemornings.com/podcast/episodes/david-kelley) on [CreativeMornings Podcast](https://creativemornings.com/podcast)

All three were very interesting interviews to me.
