Wednesday afternoon, and we're nearing the end of our trip. Time for another #japan #travellog.

Day 6 \(Sunday\), we spent the morning chilling in the hotel, waiting for Travis to checkout of his apartment. We then helped him check his stuff into the hotel and went to get ramen.

After ramen, we explored Osaka, and went looking for a new suitcase, as Melissa and I have bought too many souvenirs. Travis took us to a really cute cafe hidden inside a large amount of ivy, and we had some tea. We wandered back to the hotel and relaxed a bit before going out to dinner with Travis's old roommates. Dinner was shabu shabu and it was so much fun. Travis acted as translator in some cases, but we really enjoyed ourselves, and had a bit too much to drink.

Day 7 \(Monday\) was another travel day, as we went from Osaka to Kyoto. We rode a local JR train and it was a nice trip. It took about an hour. When we arrived we put our luggage in lockers and hunted down some lunch. Afterwards we took a cab to [our lovely AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18572755). We hung out for a bit, and then walked to downtown Kyoto for drinks and sushi.

Day 8 \(Tuesday\) we spent the morning hunting down a breakfast and then wandering Nishiki Market. Travis split up from us to have lunch with his sensei, and Melissa and I went to Ichiran, which was delicious ramen in little booths. A few hours later, Melissa went to take a nap in the apartment, and Travis and I walked the Philosophers Path, visiting some cemeteries, temples and shrines. At night, we all took brief naps and then went to get Okonomiyaki, which was absolutely delicious. Fried noodles for the win\!
