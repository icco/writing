I feel like this week is a little shorter, but I've still got some #happy links for y'all.


In the land of programming nerds, I really enjoyed this page describing [Infinity in Ruby](http://nithinbekal.com/posts/ruby-infinity/). Also @a_hailes told me about the [outages.org mailing list](https://puck.nether.net/mailman/listinfo/outages) which was very informative today [when Cogent took a nose dive](https://puck.nether.net/pipermail/outages/2016-September/009540.html).

[Good Moves](http://goodmoves.tv/) is a neat collection of motion design shorts.

[2016 Emmy Awards GIF Recap!](https://giphy.com/posts/2016-emmy-awards-gif-recap) by Giphy is proof that I don't need to watch TV anymore.

[2016 fall foliage map](http://kottke.org/16/09/2016-fall-foliage-map) is beautiful. Tells me when the trees are going to change in NY!

I'm a total sap at heart, so the NYT's [The 36 Questions That Lead to Love](http://nyti.ms/1BWQijj) from 2015 was a lot of fun to work through on a recent date.

[Bear Grylls & Marshawn Lynch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMnKzsYvHAs&feature=youtu.be) is hilarious reality television. I'm hoping someone puts up some highlights, because I can't actually sit through that much reality TV.

The Verge had a great write up on [the last year of the XOXO conference](http://www.theverge.com/2016/9/12/12884834/xoxo-fest-2016-recap).

And that's it!

Have a great week,

/Nat
