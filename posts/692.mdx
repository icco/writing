How is March and the first quarter already over\! Time is really flying this year. Well, I want to close out the quarter with one last #happy post.

* [‘The Wolf of Wall Street’ Film Was Also a Real-Life Scam](https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/the-perfect-irony-that-the-wolf-of-wall-street-was-also-a-real-life-scam) - This story is absolutely fascinating. I want more details though, so I'm hoping we get more soon.
* [bwmarrin/discordgo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo) \+ [andersfylling/disgord](https://github.com/andersfylling/disgord) - I really like discord's bot API, so I'm playing with writing bots using these API libraries.
* [How to build your own CDN with Kubernetes](https://blog.insightdatascience.com/how-to-build-your-own-cdn-with-kubernetes-5cab00d5c258?source=ifttt--------------1) is a fun experiment.
* [Muji opens a gorgeous new hotel in Ginza, Tokyo](https://www.fastcompany.com/90325977/mujis-new-hotel-is-the-greatest-ad-for-muji-yet) is surprising, I was not expecting this evolution in sales, but I guess it makes sense.
* [Questions I ask in SRE interviews](https://loganmeetsworld.com/2019/03/03/sre-interview-questions.html) is a nice write up by @\_loganmcdonald.
* [I Took Amtrak Instead of Flying and It Made Me Want to Die a Little Bit](https://jalopnik.com/i-took-amtrak-instead-of-flying-and-it-made-me-want-to-1833533707)is a depressing look into the state of trains in the USA.


And two cool announcements about big video games running on Google Cloud:

* [How Google Cloud helped Multiplay power a record-breaking Apex Legends Launch](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/customers/how-google-cloud-helped-multiplay-power-a-record-breaking-apex-legends-launch)
* [Massive Entertainment hosts Tom Clancy’s The Division 2 on Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/customers/massive-entertainment-hosts-tom-clancys-the-division-2-on-google-cloud-platform)


Also\! I finally got my related posts query to be pretty fast, so I added it to every post at the bottom. You won't see it on mobile, as I couldn't get it to look good, but if you're on desktop, you'll see it.

Have a great week\!
