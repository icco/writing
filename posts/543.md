Another week, another post of #happy. I've been watching three television series lately that I've really enjoyed: [The Expanse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(TV_series)), [Billions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billions_(TV_series)) and [The Magicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magicians_(U.S._TV_series)).

The Expanse is a fantastic sci-fi thriller. It is probably the best show to hit [SyFy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syfy) since [BSG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(2004_TV_series)). The season just ended, and the first season was fantastic. [io9 has a great summary of why the first season was great](http://io9.gizmodo.com/how-the-expanse-pulled-off-two-miracles-at-the-same-tim-1757165102), but be warned, the article does have spoilers, and the show is a mystery.

I've also been hooked on Billions, mainly just because it has two amazing actors, [Damian Lewis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damian_Lewis) and [Paul Giamatti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Giamatti), putting out fantastic performances. It's a drama through and through, but so far, it's been fantastic.

The Magicians I am basically watching because I loved [the book series](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6101718-the-magicians). So far the series has had a lot of changes from the television show, and the acting has been mediocre at best, but I found the book to be slow at first as well, so I'm going to give the show some room to grow.

Finally, [Louis CK released a surprise web series with Steve Buscemi](http://www.avclub.com/article/louis-ck-releases-surprise-web-series-steve-buscem-231520) which is super weird. Worth a watch if you like drama.

Outside of television, the latest Reply All episode, [In the Desert](https://gimletmedia.com/episode/53-in-the-desert/) is quite fantastic. It hits all the right parts of my nerdom. Also the most recent Radiolab, [I Don't Have To Answer That](http://www.radiolab.org/story/i-dont-have-answer/), taught me a bunch about history and how it affected and created the journalism of today.

I also watched the film [Burnt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnt_(film)), which had a pretty predictable plot, and amazing cinematography. It wasn't quite as good a film as [Chef](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chef_(film)), but it had a similar flavor, and I would watch both again.

[Mary Rose Cook](http://maryrosecook.com/) published herself [live programming a drum machine](http://drum-machine.maryrosecook.com/). If you like Javascript or programming for the web, it's worth checking out.

It was announced that [Julian Assange was 'unlawfully detained' in Ecuador embassy according to a U.N. panel](http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-ecuador-sweden-assange-idUKKCN0VD0BJ). This makes me super happy. I love the work that wikileaks has done, and Assange's case has been super weird.

My parents sent me a link to [Changing New York](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/changing-new-york#/?tab=about&scroll=20), an online collection from the New York Public Library which has a bunch of really cool photos of New York City from the 1930s.

My team was featured in Wired on Monday with an article titled [Clinton Camp Gives the Iowa Caucus a Silicon Valley Upgrade](http://www.wired.com/2016/01/clinton-camp-gives-the-iowa-caucus-a-silicon-valley-upgrade).

There were probably other things, but oh well! I hope you had a great week, and I wish you a good one next week as well.
