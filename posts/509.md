I have a problem. Quite simply: I very rarely finish things. Sometimes this "problem" is helpful to me, other times it is incredibly frustrating. Below I have listed some pros and cons of my current approach to personal projects. This post does not provide much of a solution, but is more of a reflective exercise.

## Pros

 * Explore a wide range of new technologies.
 * Think about a ton of different projects.

## Cons

 * Get in to funks because of "I'm never going to finish this, why even start."
 * Rarely develop very deep understand of technologies I experiment with.
