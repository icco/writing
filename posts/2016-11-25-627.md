Good morning all. It's been a month since I posted here. I think it's time to start writing again. Get back on the horse. Catch the train. Execute the plan. Jump the gap. etc.

Let's start off with movies. I'm really excited for [Ghost in the Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_Shell_(2017_film))'s 2017 live action release. The full [Ghost in the Shell Trailer](https://youtu.be/G4VmJcZR0Yg) came out recently, and despite all of the controversy surrounding the film, this trailer looks great.

[The limitations of Android N Encryption](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2016/11/24/android-n-encryption/) was a fascinating read on encryption on phones. The article does a good job of explaining the differences and limitations of different systems.

[Cartoons for the Road by The New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/cartoons-for-the-road-a-travel-slide-show?mbid=social_twitter) made me chuckle. Plus, I didn't have to travel much this year, which was nice.

[Ta-ku & Wafia](http://www.npr.org/2016/11/03/500506482/ta-ku-wafia-tiny-desk-concert) on Tiny Desk were really good.

[Just a Friendly Chat Between two Worried Late-Night Hosts](http://nyti.ms/2fcDKyu) sounded interesting. I couldn't bring myself to find a way to watch the whole thing tho.

I'm quite sad [What.cd was shut down](http://www.theverge.com/2016/11/17/13669832/what-cd-music-torrent-website-shut-down). They really did have the most complete music database of albums released in the world. Tragic to see it go.

The New York Times released a nice walkthrough on [Protecting Your Digital Life](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/17/technology/personaltech/encryption-privacy.html?_r=1).

The NYT also did a nice interview with [Frank Ocean](http://nyti.ms/2eDHzBg).

I hope everyone had a wonderful thanksgiving. You all are wonderful, and I wish you the best.

Cheers!

/Nat
