I'm up at [Lake Almanor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Almanor), and there have been a few fast moving thunder storms hitting the lake in the late afternoon. Since my dad likes to go boating, and getting caught in the middle of a lake in a thunderstorm is incredibly dangerous, we got talking about [Dark Sky](http://darkskyapp.com/).

I'm a big proponent of Dark Sky for a few reasons. The first being that [their entire API is available to the public](https://developer.forecast.io/), which means pretty much anyone can build an app against their data, so even though I'm on Android, and use [Weather Timeline](http://weathertimeline.com/), I'm still using the same dataset.

The second is they started as [a Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jackadam/dark-sky-hyperlocal-weather-prediction-and-visuali). I'm a big supporter of Kickstarters, not entirely sure why, but I back two to three projects a month. I didn't back it at the time, but I love the idea that "1,203 backers pledged $39,376 to help bring this project to life" in 2011, and now it's a largish company helping people stay dry.

The third reason is their dataset's accuracy. I was in SoHo in NYC walking with @jdherg, and he gave me an up to the minute prediction of when it would rain, that was pure magic. How they do it is by [compiling a large number of datasets](https://forecast.io/raw/)  and modifying the data to get a better picture of when rain is coming. [Adam Grossman](http://jackadam.net/) wrote a [great technical post back in 2011 about how Dark Sky works](http://blog.jackadam.net/2011/how-dark-sky-works/), also [Kickstarter did a nice interview with him on the high level details](https://www.kickstarter.com/blog/featured-creator-adam-grossman-of-dark-sky).

Anyways, the hilarious thing is a lot of people use this dataset now. [Product Hunt's Weather App List](https://www.producthunt.com/e/weather-apps) has twenty-two weather applications, and from what I can tell (some apps don't list their weather source) at least eight explicitly list [Forecast.io](https://forecast.io/) (the Dark Sky dataset) as their datasource. Only one explicitly listed another source ([8-Bit Weather](http://8bitweather.co/) lists [Yahoo](https://weather.yahoo.com/)).
