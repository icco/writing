Ok. So I missed a week. I'll admit, I'm a little burnt out. But here we are. On time for a post full of #happy!

First off if you're a Warriors fan (or just like watching basketball), check out [this highlight tape of their regular season](https://youtu.be/RECdKuQz3NA).

I haven't mentioned it, but I finished [Billions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billions_(TV_series)) which is a fantastic drama, with an amazing season finale.

I've been addicted to two new albums the last few weeks. The [new Weezer album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weezer_(2016_album)) makes me feel like I'm in middle school again, and is a fantastic return to their classic form. Then [new Moderat album, iii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/III_(Moderat_album)) is my go to coding music right now. If you can get your hands on their three disk deluxe edition, the instrumentals and remixes are just as amazing as the album itself.

Podcasts. Oh Podcasts. How I love you so. I never really listened to them until a few years ago @dmpatierno (whose birthday was April 23rd... Happy Birthday!) introduced me to [Roderick on the line](http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/). I've never looked back, and some of my favorite podcasts continue to be interviews. Since I last posted, I've listened to some fantastic interviews:

 - [Maciej Ceglowski](https://longform.org/posts/longform-podcast-189-maciej-ceglowski)
 - [Nate Silver](https://longform.org/posts/longform-podcast-188-nate-silver)
 - [Elizabeth Gilbert](https://longform.org/posts/longform-podcast-187-elizabeth-gilbert)
 - [Amanda Palmer](http://designobserver.com/feature/amanda-palmer-new/39261/)
 - [Kristen Ashburn](https://soundcloud.com/mikewalsh/kristen-ashburn)

Some articles I really enjoyed these past two weeks:

  - [Online Dating and the Death of the 'Mixed-Attractiveness' Couple](http://priceonomics.com/online-dating-and-the-death-of-the-mixed/)
 - [Notes on Google's Site Reliability Engineering book](http://danluu.com/google-sre-book/)
 - [The curious case of slow downloads](https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-curious-case-of-slow-downloads/)
 - [NYC tech catching up to Silicon Valley, while Seattle flails.](https://medium.com/@sandimac/nyc-tech-catching-up-to-silicon-valley-while-seattle-flails-here-s-why-97ba7147b5f6#.vcurd77e4)
 - [How Prince Rebelled Against the Music Industry](http://nyti.ms/212k0jH)

I never followed Prince's music career closely, but after his death, I've been working through his discography. I discovered [N.E.W.S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N.E.W.S_(Prince_album)), and I highly recommend it, if you need something completely different from his 80's pop. You can [hear it on Youtube](https://youtu.be/zRc8KLtrjxM).

I hope you have a wonderful week!
