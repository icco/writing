I have started writing this post a few times, and I decided this morning I need to just get it out there. I use AI at work. A lot.

This was not true six months ago. The tools are improving at a speed that I am impressed and also kind of scared? This week was the first week where I started to worry a bit about how AI is affecting my output, my coworkers output, and our company as a whole. This worry came from just a stark realization of how much code volume we're putting out compared to what we used to put out. Some of that is due to company growth (since January our engineering team has doubled in size), but a lot is also due to tools just getting better.

I don't think I know yet how I feel about all of these changes, so I decided instead I would just talk about the tools that are having a positive impact on my day to work, and how we're adjusting to it. I also want to write this as a snapshot. My good friend @pliable asked me "do you think there have been any significant advances in AI over the past few months?" I responded yes, but also don't have a great snapshot of where I was three months. It's a crazy time, I used to be able to hold opinions about tech and tools for one to two years. Now if I hold them more than three months, I find I am regularly wrong, based on how fast things are changing.

First off, context: I currently work at [Laurel](https://laurel.ai). I am an engineering manager for Infrastructure and Security. Coding is about 20% of my job. We as a company are investing heavily in trying to find ways to make AI useful without it being dangerous or distracting. We have two people dedicated to doing that full time. One of them wrote about his work with ["Force multiplying with AI at Laurel
"](https://kh3dron.net/blog/laurel-case-study/index.html).
