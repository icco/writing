I always think of children as "underfoot". I mean it as a compliment, where they are running around, looking at things, touching things, trying things. 

What enamors me is the curiosity. The underfootedness of it all is just a byproduct of that curiosity.

I'm glad we're not all as curious as two year olds, but I wish the average adult was a little more curious about the things around them.
