Monday. I didn't get much done. A meeting didn't happen, I bought a jacket for a funeral and got a haircut.

In the evening, I went with Ken, Steve and Ahmed to see Ex Machina at a dinner movie theater place called Nitehawk. Was a lot of fun, although the movie creeped me out a little more than I was expecting.
