Today we remember [9 / 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks). Fifteen years ago, a terrorist attack shook the world as thousands were hurt and killed. On such a somber day, it's important to remember this tragedy, but also remember a few things that make us #happy so we can soldier on.

There's a scene in [Cowboy Bebop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_Bebop), which always brings a smile to my face. Here is a part of it in gif form.

In a slightly less happy, but still good, I've just finished the second season of [BoJack Horseman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BoJack_Horseman). This show is incredibly depressing and messed up. It reminds me a lot of Californiacation. That being said, it's incredibly well done.

[Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal's 2012-12-01](http://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2012-12-01) is too real. It's like [Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_and_Out_in_the_Magic_Kingdom) in comic form, and far less sci-fi.

My mom sent me [Inside Santa Monica High](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/09/11/magazine/11mag-santa-monica-high-photo-essay.html?_r=0) which has some beautiful photography of high schoolers just living their lives.

Nieman Journalism Lab's [piece on cartoons and graphic novels](http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/08/but-its-cartoons-comics-and-cartoons-are-coming-to-life-well-beyond-the-printed-page/) is quite good.

[Color of Reality](http://www.alexameade.com/colorofreality) is a beautiful piece of art. Also, the music is amazing.

["We’re the Only Plane in the Sky"](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/were-the-only-plane-in-the-sky-214230) by Politico is an amazing long read on an often overlooked piece of September 11th.

[Vox's "Hillary Clinton's greatest strength as a politician"](https://www.facebook.com/Vox/videos/566561133531493/) is an amazing video, summarizing their July piece [Understanding Hillary](http://www.vox.com/a/hillary-clinton-interview/the-gap-listener-leadership-quality).

Humans of New York put out two fantastic pieces on HRC:

* [I'm not Barack Obama](http://www.humansofnewyork.com/post/150136510691/im-not-barack-obama-im-not-bill-clinton-both)
* [Harvard Admissions Test](http://www.humansofnewyork.com/post/150127870371/i-was-taking-a-law-school-admissions-test-in-a)

I have a somewhat secret love of fasion, and I loved [the fashion show Anna Wintour put on for Hillary Clinton](http://www.vogue.com/13473250/hillary-clinton-new-york-fashion-week-collection-huma-abedin-anna-wintour/).

I'm really stoked that the Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine plane says HillaryClinton.com on it. I can't express my excitement enough.

Today's flight on Clinton's plane will mark first time the candidate will be on the same plane as her press corps. [pic.twitter.com/PDKXoOWgt5](https://t.co/PDKXoOWgt5)— Dan Merica (@danmericaCNN)

 

So have a great week!
