Three things:

 - Beautiful art about a video game I never played "[Shadow Of The Colossus](http://www.avclub.com/article/shadow-colossus-you-bond-giants-you-slay-them-216997)" by The A.V. Club.
 - A fun game called [Monologue](http://phildo.itch.io/monologue)
 - Boing Boing found a [web-based drum machine](http://boingboing.net/2015/03/20/fun-web-based-drum-machine.html)
