Argh, can't believe I missed posting two of these on time. I was doing so well! Darn. Oh well. #happy post, let us get you out there.


So I love the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com). Here are a bunch of posts from people talking about their time there:

 - [RC 12: return statement;](https://blog.stanzheng.com/recurse/return-statement/)
 - [The Recurse Center and the joy of learning](https://martin.kleppmann.com/2015/10/11/recurse-center-joy-of-learning.html)
 - [How to never graduate](https://blog.daftcode.pl/how-to-never-graduate-ebe6578ccb89?source=ifttt--------------1)

Also related, I spoke at @hackandtell last week. It's not up there yet, but the meetup posts roundups of all of their meetings at [hackandtell/wrapup](https://github.com/hackandtell/wrapup). I talked about [onesie](https://www.onesie.website/), which I really need to do a write up of soon.


I do love that hosting is getting cheaper. The [$5 Showdown](https://joshtronic.com/2017/02/14/five-dollar-showdown-linode-vs-digitalocean-vs-lightsaild-vs-vultr/) is a great analysis of four hosting providers who provide a $5 a month virtual machine.

If you didn't know about the security risks about crossing boarders with technology "[I'll never bring my phone on an international flight again](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/ill-never-bring-my-phone-on-an-international-flight-again-neither-should-you-e9289cde0e5f?source=ifttt--------------1)" is a decent summary of all the things that can go down.

The idea to [live asynchronously](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/live-asynchronously-c8e7172fe7ea?source=ifttt--------------1) is interesting. I normally view notifications as asynchronous, but this blog article proposes to limit distractions coming from your phone. I really like it, and have been slowly removing stuff that pops up and causes me to be distracted. I am instead opting for email summaries which I can digest in the morning.

Shout out to the [Hillary Clinton's staffers who are keeping up the fight](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/18/politics/clinton-veterans-fight-trump/index.html).

I always like reading year in review type letters, and the [2017 YC Annual Letter](http://blog.samaltman.com/2017-yc-annual-letter) is pretty good.

[An nginx config for 2017](https://certsimple.com/blog/nginx-http2-load-balancing-config) is a great walk through of all of the crazy stuff going on with http/2 and ipv6 and SSL and nginx. If you run NGINX, it's worth a read.

I love stuff like [Tracking Your Phone On the Tube](http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2017/02/heres-what-tfl-learned-from-tracking-your-phone-on-the-tube/). I find cell phones a fascinating way to track movement of people through public infrastructure and as a way to optimize and make people's lives better.

Despite [Betteridge's law of headlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge's_law_of_headlines), the answer to [Is PostgreSQL good enough?](https://renesd.blogspot.com/2017/02/is-postgresql-good-enough.html) is yes, most of the time.

I've been telling people about [First Look Media](https://firstlook.media/) lately, and the [Neiman Lab](http://www.niemanlab.org/) article "[First Look Media is building a new platform](http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/06/first-look-media-is-building-a-new-platform-that-aims-to-include-everything-from-films-to-podcasts/)" is a decent summary of the work they are doing.

[Mateusz Urbanowicz's "Tokyo Storefront" series](http://mateuszurbanowicz.com/tokyo-storefront-illustration-series) is gorgeous.

[A new E-Ink tablet](http://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/12/2/13818796/remarkable-giant-e-ink-tablet-paper-notebook) is supposed to be coming out soon, and looks pretty awesome.

There were four great podcast interviews I listened to recently:

 - [Episode 231: Brooke Gladstone - Longform](http://pca.st/K9Ap)
 - [Anil Dash - Design Matters with Debbie Millman](http://pca.st/rX9Z)
 - [Lyft: John Zimmer - How I Built This](http://pca.st/gOe6)
 - [Solange - Cranes in the Sky - Song Exploder](http://pca.st/Z0YG)

I hope you are having a great week!
