Music

- I've always loved Boiler Room sets. Three of them I particularly enjoyed recently because of their high energy and fun vibes. Two were both from a collection of sets put on one night in Tokyo called [Tohji Presents u-ha](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLx3QyNMosJdykwV0IdqvNzOWnnXMXQMot&si=pRcwRPSPCjd_okY_). The other is from a night in Osaka called [Fullhouse](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLx3QyNMosJdwio0_MO9EqRimjwEC9uHfY&si=sXUtzaRjeD8jQ1h6).
