Ok, I missed a few #happy posts, but I've got this one! 

TV & Movies

- The hype behind the anime [Solo Leveling]() has been huge, but I didn't get it until this most recent episode. The writing is still terrible, but the action scene art is getting great.
- I watched the Super Bowl, it was fine.
- [This goal by the Spurs]() was fantastic.
- I started [Mr. and Mrs. Smith]() and so far it's delightful.
- Rewatched Bocchi The Rock, and it's still my anime of 2023.

Music

- I've always loved Boiler Room sets. Three of them I particularly enjoyed recently because of their high energy and fun vibes. Two were both from a collection of sets put on one night in Tokyo called [Tohji Presents u-ha](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLx3QyNMosJdykwV0IdqvNzOWnnXMXQMot&si=pRcwRPSPCjd_okY_). The other is from a night in Osaka called [Fullhouse](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLx3QyNMosJdwio0_MO9EqRimjwEC9uHfY&si=sXUtzaRjeD8jQ1h6).

Read

- I finished [The Library at Mount Char]() a few weeks ago and really enjoyed it. An interesting mix of end of the world sci-fi and fantasy. 

Play

- I'm still chugging through Baulders Gate 3. basically just have three big fights left I think.
