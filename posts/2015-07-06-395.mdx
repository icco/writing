I've been thinking about building a website to annotate the world. This concept was inspired by [Eden of the East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eden_of_the_East), an Anime I watched a while back \(2009... wow, time flies\). In the show "Eden of the East" is the name of a mobile application developed by several of the secondary characters. The app can recognize and provide details about objects, and is linked to a user database where people can post pictures to find out what they are. I want to build something like this that allows for the world to annotate photos, videos and audio.

I was talking to my dad yesterday during our car trip about the idea, and he asked the classic question: why would people contribute? Which then got me thinking about Wikipedia. Why do people contribute to Wikipedia?

@alwaysunday reminded me that [ReplyAll](http://gimletmedia.com/show/reply-all/) did a [great episode on a Wikipedia contributor](http://gimletmedia.com/episode/14-the-art-of-making-and-fixing-mistakes/). Which then led me to [this Medium article about the same guy](https://medium.com/backchannel/meet-the-ultimate-wikignome-10508842caad). The article and the episode are both interesting, but cover the same content of this impressive editor.

Because this is the internet, [we have this article by David Golumbia](http://www.uncomputing.org/?p=1622) which explains why this guy shouldn't be heralded for his work. But he does go into a lot of good background about contributing to #communities and "the best type of people" to keep in those communities.

Both of these articles quote a talk \(and of course don't link to it\). [The talk proposal is online](https://wikimania2012.wikimedia.org/wiki/Submissions/“This_is_my_voice”:_the_motivations_of_highly_active_Wikipedians), as is [a video of Maryana Pinchuk and Steven Walling's talk](https://youtu.be/L_Ng60B0mKU?t=39m23s). 

It's quite a good talk. Basically a few Wikimedians analyzed a bunch of interviews of editors to find out why they contributed to Wikipedia in 2011. Some of the reasons they listed that people participate on Wikipedia:

* People who like Autonomy, #Wikipedia attracts people who like to be able to express whatever interests them.
* The Jimmy Wales motivational change the world reason tended to only come up when prompted.
* Topical interests: Someone is already obsessed with a topic, find Wikipedia from Google, finds the article wrong, edits it.
* People who edit because they know people will use their work.
* Perfectionists \(this is where the quotes from both articles come from, 48:50\)
* The challenge \(50 new pages with this thing I like to fix appeared last night\)
* People who like to write, express their talents as a writer
* Responsibility for content
* Plain old addiction
* Feeling of recognition, peer validation
* Self\-expression
* personal fulfillment

The point they got out of this, which seems like a reasonable outcome, is that Wikipedia needs better tools for editors, because they are for the most part, doing it because they enjoy it.

Something to think about.
