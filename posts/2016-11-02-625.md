November! New #happy post. New month. 

Let's start off with what I am telling everyone is the best thirty minutes of television this election season: [The Daily Show, October 31, 2016](http://www.cc.com/full-episodes/nb3429/the-daily-show-with-trevor-noah-october-31--2016---jeff-ross-season-22-ep-22016).

No where near as good, but still cool, is the [Silver Surfer in NYC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePd3dL7C-CM&feature=youtu.be) video.

ASAD released the first of his new series of music videos called [BERLIN](https://vimeo.com/189704067). Really enjoying it.

Probably my favorite design firm right now is [automato.farm](http://automato.farm/), and their newest piece "[Politics of Power](http://automato.farm/portfolio/politics-of-power/)" is so cool.

Earlier last week, I wrote up [my favorite endorsements of Hillary Clinton](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/623).

[GifCities](http://www.gifcities.org/) is just a beautiful archive of internet culture

[ZEIÂº](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/timeular/zeio-the-most-simple-time-tracking-solution/) is a neat Kickstarter that @pw10n sent me. Send him your love, [he got married last weekend](https://www.instagram.com/p/BMKjtF4AUoD/?taken-by=pw10n)

The US presidential election is a week from today! [Please vote](http://iwillvote.com)!

Cheers,

/Nat
