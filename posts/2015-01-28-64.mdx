This site is amazing. Such a cool combination of discovery, music, color and art. According to the readme, the color names are from [XKCD's Color Survey](https://xkcd.com/color/rgb/) and the data comes from [iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes/affiliates/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api.html).

 > We want to design things that can elevate an experience beyond completing a task or solving a problem, to a memorable encounter that has a positive or fulfilling effect, in even the smallest of ways.

...

 > With Predominant.ly, we want to bring an element of serendipity back into the search for music, making the experience as personal and delightful as stumbling across a long-forgotten favourite in a second hand record store.
