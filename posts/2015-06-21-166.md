I slept in late on Friday. I needed it, felt pretty ragged. I came into RC around three in the afternoon. I had a large lunch and then started reading [The Magician King](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10079321-the-magician-king) because everyone said the series gets better.

In the evening, I met Ken in Williamsburg and went to [Fette Sau](http://www.fettesaubbq.com/). We've been talking about doing this since we started RC, so it was nice to finally do it. Really good, but I think I liked [Dinosaur BBQ](http://www.dinosaurbarbque.com/bbq-brooklyn) better.

On Saturday, my roommate and some of her friends, plus Aaron, Kristen and their friend Victoria, went to the Mermaid parade. It was pretty overcast, but it was full of people, so I guess that's cool. Afterwards some of us had delicious Russian dumplings in Brighton Beach.

In the evening Heidi and Ken threw a potluck dinner party at their house. It had a great turnout and was a blast.

Sunday was a slow day. I sat in Washington Square park and read for a bit. Then I worked on [my mood board](http://mood.natwelch.com) for a few hours. I want to change how I store data to get around the fact that if a lot of people visit it, I blow my dribbble API quota.

I'm having dinner with Rohen later tonight (Sunday). He just moved to the city, so that's cool.
