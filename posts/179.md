Wednesday, second to last day of RC and NYC (for now). Early on in the day I added pagination to my blog's index page. I finally only show the last 50 posts, instead of all of them. Ken helped me fix the [archive page](https://writing.natwelch.com/archives) to be bounded by months I have posted in. I had some complicated boolean logic, and we stepped back and turned it into a much simpler for loop.

I also was able to fix the alignment to allow for the days to be all lined up.

This then transitioned into helping Ken [ruberduck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) his [Java byte code generation project](https://web.archive.org/web/20241115164618/https://github.com/kenpratt/jvm-assembler).

After a nice coffee walk, we continued iteration on the "Recurser Social Directory". You can't visit if you aren't in RC, but here is a screen shot of where we got on Wednesday.

In the evening I checked into a nice hotel in FiDi and wrote my "Farewell" sentences to everyone. I've realized there are a few people in my batch I was not nearly social enough with. [sadnat.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20240522150946/https://sadnat.com:443/).
