I for some reason don't really remember last week... so I'm just going to dig through some articles I read, try and find some #happy in there.

Two Hillary Clinton related articles: [Millennials for Hillary Have a Plan to Prove They Exist](http://www.wired.com/2016/03/millennials-hillary-plan-prove-exist/) & [This may shock you: Hillary Clinton is fundamentally honest](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/28/hillary-clinton-honest-transparency-jill-abramson).

I loved playing with [reddit Robin](http://www.redditblog.com/2016/04/robin.html). I find community building incredibly fascinating, and time limited chat rooms were very interesting to play with.

Google released [Site Reliability Engineering](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920041528.do) with through O'Reilly. They were working on this book when I was there, and really wanted to contribute. I'm looking forward to reading it.  It's [34% off on Amazon right now](http://amzn.to/1RVWHYr).

The only April Fools joke that I really enjoyed was [Mark Zuckerberg × H&M](http://markforhm.com/). And it killed me.

My article in [Issue 6 of Code Words](https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/six), titled [Promoting reliability in web software companies](https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/six/promoting-reliability-in-web-software-companies), was published. I've really enjoyed writing about SRE related topics for Code Words. I also wrote a piece titled [DDoS and you](https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/three/ddos-and-you) in [Issue 3 of Code Words](https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/three). The two communities that usually eat up Code Words pieces, hn and Twitter, tend not react as positively to posts about web operations

I came across two great things from my favorite genre, Cyberpunk:

* [Amazing Cyberpunk Beer Commercial By The Makers Of Ghost In The Shell](http://io9.gizmodo.com/amazing-cyberpunk-beer-commercial-by-the-makers-of-ghos-1554510274)
* [Cyberpunk Illustrations of a Dystopian Future](http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/cyberpunk-art-book-gonzales)

I enjoyed listening to [Design Matters with Debbie Millman Featuring Branding Designers Greg Hahn \+ Ryan Moore](http://designobserver.com/feature/greg-hahn--ryan-moore/39250/). Particularly interesting was looking through all of their work at their agency, [Gretel](http://gretelny.com/).

I found WIRED's article "[It’s 2016. Why Can’t Anyone Make a Decent Freaking To-Do App?](http://www.wired.com/2016/03/best-to-do-list-app?mbid=social_fb)" hilarious, because I am constantly unhappy with Todo apps, and always revert back to paper, which isn't efficent for me to find things. We really just need computers that can read our minds.

Finally, @mrmrs\_ tweeted a quote that I really liked:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Everything you&#39;ve been taught about front-end development might be wrong. <br>Ask questions. Challenge everything. <a href="https://t.co/oq1myGqPlq">pic.twitter.com/oq1myGqPlq</a></p>&mdash; murmurs <a href="https://twitter.com/mrmrs\_/status/714594239502557184">March 28, 2016</a></blockquote>
