2012 was a fantastic year for Nathaniel Welch. When [2011](http://pseudoweb.net/2011/12/26/2011-year-in-review/) ended, I wasn't really sure what I wanted to do with my next year. That being said, wandering aimlessly through the year I managed to have a lot of fun thanks to my friends and family.

## January:

January was a simple month. I moved to a new office at Google \(GWC2\), attended Heroku's Waza and cooked dumplings with my roommates.

## February:

In February, I celebrated my 24th birthday. I also went up to Santa Rosa and tasted the delicious "Pliny the Younger" at Russian River Brewing Company and went snowboarding in Tahoe at Squaw with Google Commerce.
