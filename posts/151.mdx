Lets see, Friday. We went and saw [The New York Earth Room](http://www.diaart.org/sites/main/earthroom). It was interesting... not what I expected at all.

Kept working on [Meet](https://github.com/icco/meet).

In the evening [Brad](https://twitter.com/DaveyPocket), [Ken](https://twitter.com/ken_pratt), [Steve](https://twitter.com/ifosteve), [Aaron](https://twitter.com/aaronbshaw) and I tried to see [Manhattanhenge](http://www.amnh.org/our-research/hayden-planetarium/resources/manhattanhenge). It was too cloudy, so we just got a bunch of walking in.
