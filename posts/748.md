Had a discussion with a friend online about how amazing Jamie XX's "In Colour"   is, and how excited we were for his new album coming out next month. This got me thinking about what my favorite "dance" albums are. So I decided to put together a list and a playlist.

I'm not a professional reviewer, so this list isn't in order, nor particularly deeply researched, but rather albums I keep coming back to time and time again. So lets dive into a fun listicle!

## Jamie xx - In Colour

This album is perfect for me. High energy, lots of unique samples, and interesting beats. I originally learned about Jamie xx from listening to The xx, whom I love. I then started to hear some of his live sets (my favorite being [Jamie xx Boiler Room London x Young Turks DJ Set](https://youtu.be/HV-nNEXgsOk?si=4m7OsqR3AwO6Hg3D)), and his collaboration with Gil Scott-Heron, [We're New Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We%27re_New_Here).

When I listen to this album, I'm back living in London in 2014 & 2015. The sound just makes me think of big cities, full of diversity, movement and chaos.

## Beyonce - Renaissance

The newest album on this list. This was basically the anthem for my 2023. I generally love Beyonce, but this album was a whole new vibe. It reminds me of the house music I loved in high school and college, and just makes me want to dance.

This album usually makes me think of the fantastic DJ Sprinkles, in particular her album [Midtown 120 Blues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midtown_120_Blues) and the outro of her song Ball'r:

> When Madonna came out with her hit "Vogue" you knew it was over. She'd taken a very specifically queer, transgender, Latino and African-American phenomenon and totally erased that context with lyrics about how "It makes no difference if you're black or white, if you're a boy or a girl." Madonna was taking in tons of money, while the Queen who actually taught her how to vogue was sitting on a table in front of me, broke. So if anybody requested "Vogue" or any other Madonna track, I just told them, "No, this is a Madonna-free zone! And as long as I'm DJ-ing, you will not be allowed to vogue to the decontextualized, reified, corporatized, liberalized, neutralized, asexualized, re-genderized pop reflection of this dance floor's reality! - [Source](https://genius.com/Dj-sprinkles-ballr-madonna-free-zone-lyrics) 

Beyonce has talked extensively about how dance music influenced her as an artist. NYT did a great dive [into the decades of dance music it was inspired by](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/29/arts/music/beyonce-renaissance-dance-music-guide.html). Compared to the Madonna quote, Beyonce can be seen hyping the underground dance scenes while still making commercialization off of it.

## Justice - cross

This album, as well as their album Audio, Video, Disco, is the soundtrack for incident response. If something is going wrong at work late at night or early in the morning, this is playing in the background. It always gets me going. I've seen this album performed live, I've listened to it hundreds of times in the dead of night, and every time it gets my adrenaline pumping.

If I was a true adrenaline junkie, I'd be living to this all of the time. 

Their new album Hyperdrama is also quite good, but doesn't get my blood pumping as much. But change is good!

## Kaskade - Strobelite Seduction

Hmm, describing this album is hard. For me, this album is late nights working in computer labs in college. It's sexy, it's slow, it's calming. One of my roommates in college, Prentice, and I constantly traded dance music recommendations back and forth. I introduced him to Kaskade, he introduced me to Daft Punk.

Because this album was so seminal to my college computer science degree, and often in the background when I was working at iFixit at the time, this style of music is often what I have playing while I'm working today. Vocals that don't mean anything, calm beats, good vibes.

## Deadmau5 - Random Album Title

This came out when I was regularly going to festivals. I saw Deadmau5 a bunch of times, and listening to this I feel like I'm on drugs in a field dancing at sunset.

## Burial - untrue 

Ugh, how do I describe this album. This album is why Bandcamp will always have a special place in my heart. 

## The Avalanches - Since I left you

Introduced to me by a classmate Ben while studying, this album sent me down a rabbit hole. Sample heavy, chaotic, electronic music. I don't expect to ever hear this in a club, and I don't like a lot of the remixes done of it. But it is a perfect piece of work to me. 



## Daft punk - Tron: Legacy

The movie was good, but the soundtrack was better.

## Dj Shadow - Endtroducing...

This is what I listen to when I go for walks at night. I wrote about this in college for an English essay, and my professor used it as a teaching moment for me to learn about privilege. 

## Moby - Destroyed

Jet lag the album.
