Had a discussion with a friend online about how amazing Jamie XX's "In Colour"   is, and how excited we were for his new album coming out next month. This got me thinking about what my favorite "dance" albums are. So I decided to put together a list and a playlist.

I'm not a professional reviewer, so this list isn't in order, nor particularly deeply researched, but rather albums I keep coming back to time and time again.

## Jamie xx - In Colour


## Beyonce - Renaissance 


## Justice - cross


## Kascade - 

## Deadmau5 -

## Burial - untrue 


## The Avalanches - Since I left you
## Daft punk 
## Dj Shadow endtroducing

## ???
