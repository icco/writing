Had a discussion with a friend online about how amazing Jamie XX's "In Colour"   is, and how excited we were for his new album coming out next month. This got me thinking about what my favorite "dance" albums are. So I decided to put together a list and a playlist.

I'm not a professional reviewer, so this list isn't in order, nor particularly deeply researched, but rather albums I keep coming back to time and time again. So lets dive into a fun listicle!

## Jamie xx - In Colour

This album is perfect for me. High energy, lots of unique samples, and interesting beats. I originally learned about Jamie xx from listening to The xx, whom I love. I then started to hear some of his live sets (my favorite being [Jamie xx Boiler Room London x Young Turks DJ Set](https://youtu.be/HV-nNEXgsOk?si=4m7OsqR3AwO6Hg3D)), and his collaboration with Gil Scott-Heron, [We're New Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We%27re_New_Here).

When I listen to this album, I'm back living in London in 2014 & 2015. The sound just makes me think of big cities, full of diversity, movement and chaos.

## Beyonce - Renaissance

The newest album on this list. This was basically the anthem for my 2023. I generally love Beyonce, but this album was a whole new vibe. It reminds me of the house music I loved in high school and college, and just makes me want to dance.

This album usually makes me think of the fantastic DJ Sprinkles, in particular her album [Midtown 120 Blues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midtown_120_Blues) and the outro of her song Ball'r:

> When Madonna came out with her hit "Vogue" you knew it was over. She'd taken a very specifically queer, transgender, Latino and African-American phenomenon and totally erased that context with lyrics about how "It makes no difference if you're black or white, if you're a boy or a girl." Madonna was taking in tons of money, while the Queen who actually taught her how to vogue was sitting on a table in front of me, broke. So if anybody requested "Vogue" or any other Madonna track, I just told them, "No, this is a Madonna-free zone! And as long as I'm DJ-ing, you will not be allowed to vogue to the decontextualized, reified, corporatized, liberalized, neutralized, asexualized, re-genderized pop reflection of this dance floor's reality! - [Source](https://genius.com/Dj-sprinkles-ballr-madonna-free-zone-lyrics) 

Beyonce has talked extensively about how dance music influenced her as an artist. NYT did a great dive [into the decades of dance music it was inspired by](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/29/arts/music/beyonce-renaissance-dance-music-guide.html). Compared to the Madonna quote, Beyonce can be seen hyping the underground dance scenes while still making commercialization off of it.

## Justice - cross

This album, as well as their album Audio, Video, Disco, is the soundtrack for incident response. If something is going wrong at work late at night or early in the morning, this is playing in the background. It always gets me going. I've seen this album performed live, I've listened to it hundreds of times in the dead of night, and every time it gets my adrenaline pumping.

If I was a true adrenaline junkie, I'd be living to this all of the time.
