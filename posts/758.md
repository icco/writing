Happy April!

March is out the door, and it went by so fast.

Some updates:

- I did some research on publishing to make sure my understandings of cost and shipping times and things still line up with the research I did in... 2023. It does! So that's great.
- I wrote 3843 words in March. This is a net change, so very possible I wrote more, but I deleted others.
- I migrated my work from Markdown to Typst. It seemed like a better format for working towards printing.

This is a shorter update this month, thank you all for the support. If there are certain things you would like to see in these updates, please let me know!

Thanks!
