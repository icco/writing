It feels weird writing a #happy post on 9 / 11, but I also feel sorry I didn't get a post out this past weekend. So to all who died on 9/11, and also to all who are suffering due to terrorism and natural disasters, I'm thinking of you.

[Donate to Red Cross](https://www.redcross.org/donate/donation) to help those in need. If you're one of those people ready to send memes about how Red Cross is the worst or some other nonsense, check out [their Charity Navigator page](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=3277) to see why they are a great place to donate money.

Ok, now to the links. The happy.

So first off, I've been playing a bunch of Destiny 2 and enjoying it. [Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/2017/5/20/15659696/destiny-2-faq-planets-classes-subclasses-weapons-armor-light-engrams-story-raid-crucible-strikes) and [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/5/16253052/destiny-2-launch-gameplay-preview-impressions) have substantial write-ups of the game at launch. Also worth reading is this old article about [The Messy, True Story Behind The Making Of Destiny](https://kotaku.com/the-messy-true-story-behind-the-making-of-destiny-1737556731) from 2015.


I enjoyed @tomdale's think piece "[Compilers are the New Frameworks](https://tomdale.net/2017/09/compilers-are-the-new-frameworks/)"

I've been thinking of going back to reading via RSS now that I'm having trouble surfacing things from twitter because of their weird timeline. [Why RSS Still Beats Facebook and Twitter for Tracking News](https://fieldguide.gizmodo.com/why-rss-feeds-still-beat-facebook-and-twitter-for-track-1800722740) is a nice little write-up on how to get back to using RSS.

[Leslie Jones At Fashion Week Has Breathed New Life Into My Cold, Decomposing Corpse](https://www.buzzfeed.com/sheridanwatson/leslie-jones-went-to-fashion-week#.ecdVZAJmK). Jones is the celebrity we need.

[Ingress - Burning Man Sunrise Set 2017 by Tycho](https://soundcloud.com/tycho/ingress-burning-man-sunrise-set-2017) is beautiful.


[Hillary Clinton On Losing the 2016 Presidential Election & Her Marriage to Bill](https://www.vogue.com/article/hillary-clinton-memoir-election-marriage/amp) is sad, but it makes me excited for her book. If you read my blog, you're probably aware I love retrospectives and check-ins and emotional reflection, so I am here for HRC to drop her feelings onto the world.

[Dear Amazon, We Picked Your New Headquarters for You](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/09/upshot/where-should-amazon-new-headquarters-be.html?_r=0) is an excellent look at US cities. I wish they included all of North America in their study though.

Action Bronson's videos are profane and silly, but [How-To Make Action Bronson's Chicken Parm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSQzDC8RSeE&feature=youtu.be) was enjoyable.

[To the Burner who pulled a shit-covered plastic jug out of the port-a-potty](https://medium.com/@peterpann/to-the-burner-who-pulled-a-sh-t-covered-plastic-jug-out-of-the-porta-potty-659cb2aec253?source=ifttt--------------1) is a beautiful piece about celebrating people for doing good work and not expecting any praise.

@AlexTinkerer posted that a project he's been working on is finally becoming a reality, and the press release sounds awesome: [Blizzard Arena Opens in Los Angeles](https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/blizzard/21045530/blizzard-arena-opens-in-los-angeles)

In the fresh news out of a tragic news cycle category: [Delta Goes Big, Then Goes Home](https://www.flightradar24.com/blog/delta-goes-big-then-goes-home/)

I enjoyed this Wired article on [The DNC’s CTO](https://www.wired.com/story/the-dncs-technology-chief-is-phishing-his-staff-good?mbid=social_fb). I want the DNC to get their shit together and move forward, and this is a good sign.

I've been enjoying the [What's Good Podcast](http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510323/whats-good-with-stretch-and-bobbito), and I liked the [Dave Chappelle & Donnell Rawlings](http://pca.st/oha0) episode.

[Atomic City](https://longreads.com/2017/09/05/atomic-city/) is a sad but fascinating story of nuclear testing in the US.

[Drink Seltzer, Live Forever](https://www.eater.com/2017/8/30/16193300/la-croix-polar-seltzer-live-forever) is a long-form article about seltzer.

[List of United States hurricanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_hurricanes) is excellent data, and what's even cooler is the references section has all of the raw data from NOAA.

[Rapid release at massive scale](https://code.facebook.com/posts/270314900139291/rapid-release-at-massive-scale/) is a fascinating look into how Facebook releases [have changed since 2012](https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/release-engineering-and-push-karma-chuck-rossi/10150660826788920/)


[September Startup Sprint](https://www.indiehackers.com/@AndrewAskins/3937cd3f90) sounds cool. I'm not participating but should be fun to watch.

A few of my ex-coworkers are speaking at [SRE, Security, and Presidential Campaigns - devopsdays Boston 2017](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2017-boston/program/ben-hagen/). Sadly I can't make it, but it should be awesome.

[D3 Traveler Duffel](https://sdrtraveller.com/products/d3-traveller?variant=17489063107) is impressive but expensive hardware. I learned about it from the incredibly fascinating [first episode of the On Margins Podcast](https://craigmod.com/onmargins/001/). @craigmod continues to put out excellent content.

Have a great week! I wish you the best.
