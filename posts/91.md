Recurse Center Day 0. Summary: Whoa. So many people. 

I spent today for the first time [realizing I'm in a similar time zone](https://twitter.com/icco/status/582578688329404417) as my friends again, which is super weird, and then also getting this constant stream of meeting new faces. I had conversations today with people named [Cory](https://twitter.com/corydominguez), Rob, [Steve](https://twitter.com/ifosteve), Jesse, Alex, Emma and [Nick](https://twitter.com/nicholasbs). Chatted over beers with [Jenna](http://twitter.com/zeigenvector), [Gonçalo](https://twitter.com/gnclmorais) and [Agustín](https://twitter.com/agustinbenassi). Plus brief hand shakings and introductions with a bunch of other people.

After a fun introduction to RC \(with lots of advice and introductions and whatnots\), I sat down and read [timbray's Google \+ 1yr post](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2015/03/29/Anniversaries). All of this makes sense, although at only one week outside of the machine, I don't know how I feel yet.

Jesse pointed me at [Joshua Davis](http://www.joshuadavis.com/). His personal site has all of this cool stuff, including his work [with Diplo](https://vimeo.com/93623889) and his work [with Phantomgram](https://vimeo.com/89801609).

I watched two talks by him, [one for Toyota](https://youtu.be/-iKkEpW0N5Q) and one [from W3Conf](https://youtu.be/LJS4fBjdPM4).

I reread through [Mike Bostock's](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/) [Visualizing Algorithms](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/algorithms/) post\. This post reminded me how much I had to learn.

Things I had forgotten / didn’t know:

* [JS Bitwise OPs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_Operators) - I didn’t know what `<<=` did\.
* [Spanning Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_tree) and [Minimum Spanning Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree) - It’s been so long since I last thought about this stuff. The wikipedia pages aren’t very good, I’ll need to go dig out a better source for graph stuff and reread it.

Stuff to read next:

* http://corte.si/posts/code/visualisingsorting/
* Prim’s Algorithm
* [Shader School](https://github.com/stackgl/shader-school)

Code to read through:

* [Prim’s Algorithm](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/11159599) and [Prim’s Algorithm III](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/11377353)
* [Random Traversal](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/70a28267db0354261476)
* [Randomized Depth-First](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1ef3b1fb9eb35ca8ffff)

Other random stuff to look into:

The day ended with a talk by @neha. She talked about the high level types of problems existing in database systems, focusing on how CAP, ACID and other uses of the word consistency work. I have experienced a lot of this during my time at Google, but her talk made me realize I really didn't understand a lot of the fundamental problems that were being dealt with and the decisions that were being made. I hope I can sit down and talk to her more, she seems super interesting.

A great day\! Here's to many more.
