Continuing with #tenbysix this week\!

## Stuff I worked on this week:

Throughout this week I got [Creepermon](https://github.com/icco/creepermon) scraping things. I'm putting the data into Keen.io.

![scrape times](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/161y2E1t253s0F3K1X1I/Screen%!S%28MISSING)

Their explore tool gave me this nice graph. On the left side, you'll notice that the yellow line, writing.natwelch.com, has the worst response time. This was due to a bad query on the stats page, which led me down a rabbit hole where I decided to change how my blog looks, which ended up with me changing how natwelch.com looks. So yeah, that happened. But hey, now the site is faster\!

I also spent some time thinking about [Gandalf](https://github.com/icco/gandalf). I wrote [some stuff down](https://github.com/icco/gandalf/blob/a6a62c1050e5e5fe1f676cbf91e6ef0bbe4ecf4f/story.md) about what the story might be. Basically setting the tone, like an anime opening sequence or something...
