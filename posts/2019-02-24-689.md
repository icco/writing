Afternoon\! Here we are trying to get back in the #happy routine\! Huzzah\!

One great listen: Two different podcasts have done great interviews with the two sides of the Flickr team. I enjoyed both, and they had an interesting look on their past lives together.
* [How I Built This: Stewart Butterfield](https://www.npr.org/2018/07/27/633164558/slack-flickr-stewart-butterfield)
* [Without Fail: Caterina Fake](https://www.gimletmedia.com/without-fail/the-accidental-technologist-caterina-fake)


One great watch: Umbrella Academy on Netflix. Was a fun thriller with good twists and interesting characters. The first season ends on a bit of a cliff hanger though. 

One great read: [Station Eleven by Emily St. John Mandel](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20170404-station-eleven) is an interesting post\-apocalyptic novel. A large amount of the story is about how the characters lives intersect done through flashbacks. I don't normally like these types of stories, but I really enjoyed this one.
