I just started listening to http://songexploder.net/ after being recommended it a ton of times. The reason I finally took the plunge was being recommended it by [Pocket Casts](http://www.shiftyjelly.com/pocketcasts), which I just switched to from [Podcast Addict](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&hl=en).

PocketCasts has been pretty good so far. It has most of the features I want in a podcast listener, and recommends podcasts, which is always nice. The two features they seem broken:

 1. Unsubscribing from a podcast is hidden in the settings for a podcast.
 2. You can easily mass mark episodes as listened to, but to mark them as unlistened, you either have to add them to a playlist, or go through one by one, which is a pain.

What I'm listening to now:

![what](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/3o2p1B3r1N3Z2J0F431x/20150717232141.png)

 - [Internet of Things](http://iotpodcast.com/): Haven't listened to yet, was recommended.
 - [Science Friday](http://www.sciencefriday.com/): I listen to one or two a month. These are pretty hit or miss.
 - [Reconcilable Differences](http://www.relay.fm/rd/): New Merlin Mann. I love his stuff, but I'm not sold on this yet.
 - [What's The Point](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/introducing-fivethirtyeight-newest-podcast-whats-the-point/): I like @fivethirtyeight's writing, and these have been good so far.
 - [XLR8R](http://www.xlr8r.com/podcasts/): Great electronic music
 - [Roderick on the Line](http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/): Good, but I can only listen to one or two a week before I get overwhelmed. Highly recommend starting at the beginning, it's just so many inside jokes now. I usually listen to the newest episode and an older episode each week.
 - [Rachel and Miles X-Plain the X-Men](http://www.rachelandmiles.com/xmen/): A couple tries to explain x-men plot lines. Hilarious.
 - [Isometric](https://www.relay.fm/isometric): Recommended, have not listened to yet.
 - [Coffee & Cider](http://www.esn.fm/coffeecider/): I love these two, but I'm not sold on it yet. It's like a short Roderick.
 - [Design Matters](http://www.debbiemillman.com/designmatters/): The best design interviews out there. I think in my three or four years listening I can only remember one bad interview (the episode she interviewed the two guys from Mailchimp).
 - [Sufficiently Human](http://sufficientlyhuman.com/): Good, but I think they stopped making them.
 - [Song Exploder](http://songexploder.net/): Great discussions on song creation by the artists themselves.
 - [Startup](https://gimletmedia.com/show/startup/): Each season follows a startup.
 - [ReplyAll](https://gimletmedia.com/show/reply-all/): Interesting stories from the internet. I really love their Yes, Yes, No segment where they explain internet phenomena.
 - [Mystery Show](https://gimletmedia.com/show/mystery-show/): Weird premise, but cool stories about weird mysteries.
