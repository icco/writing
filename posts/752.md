I learned yesterday that one of my favorite all time podcasts, [The Longform Podcast](https://longform.org/), ended over the summer. I have been an active listener for a long time, but always many episodes behind. The earliest mention on my blog is from [October 2015](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/413), but I was listening before then according to my writing then.
