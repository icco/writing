On [Fedi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse), one thing I've really enjoyed following last year and this is #decemberadventure. It was [first defined by Eli](https://eli.li/december-adventure) in 2022, but I just found out about it last December. I didn't have any particular plan to participate this year, but during thanksgiving, I noticed the Agents tab on the GitHub Mobile App.

I know there is a strong anti-LLM bend to a lot of the Fediverse and the art-communities that I belong to. I have very complicated feelings about the term AI and its vilification. I deeply understand the arguments around both training and usage, but I still use it heavily at work and occasionally in my personal life. Given I use it so heavily at work, I have found myself exploring LLMs more and more as a tool for creation. 

To that end, I used it to create a dumb little discord bot almost entirely using the Agent in the Github Mobile App on Android. This was neat because I basically gave the agent tasks while I helped cook Thanksgiving Dinner. Since then I have made some manual changes, and added some features, but it has now been stable for a few weeks and I wanted to share what I built.
