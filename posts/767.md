On Fedi, one thing I've really enjoyed following last year and this is #decemberadventure. It was [first defined by Eli](https://eli.li/december-adventure) in 2022, but I just found out about it last December. I didn't have any particular plan to participate this year, but during thanksgiving, I noticed the Agents tab on the GitHub Mobile App.
