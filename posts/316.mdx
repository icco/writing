I think Lucre is an interesting idea. Create a single serving page to let a person receive money. But I think he's missing the point, as there is no incentive to give him the money. This seems to be the issue I see with certain technologies and companies as well. Sure you've made a cool technology, but the reason to use it is missing or nonsensical.
