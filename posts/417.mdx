I read two very disturbing stories today:

 - [TPP will ban rules that require source-code disclosure](https://boingboing.net/2015/11/06/tpp-will-ban-rules-that-requir.html)
 - [EU wants to require permission to make a link on the Web](https://boingboing.net/2015/11/08/eu-wants-to-require-permission.html)

Basically, I'm scared for the future of the internet.
