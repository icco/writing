This month has kind of sucked. You'll notice a half-finished homepage here, mainly because I relaunched my site in frustration. Lots of things are broken, but if there is something you particularly miss, please let me know [by email](mailto:nat@natwelch.com) or @icco on Twitter. 

Anyways, let us do a #happy post to close out the week, lighten my mood.

So, I haven't been caught up with the Anime airing in a while, so I enjoyed reading r/anime's [End of Summer 2017 Survey Results!](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/760u9k/the_end_of_summer_2017_survey_results/). From this list, I've started watching [RE:Creators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Re:Creators), [Princess Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Principal) and [Gamers!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamers!). We shall see how many I stick with, but I'm enjoying them all so far.

While I was looking for anime, I also went looking for new movies and television:

 - [The Best TV Shows of 2017 (So Far)](http://www.vulture.com/article/best-tv-shows-of-2017-so-far.html)
 - [The Best Movies of 2017 (So Far)](http://www.vulture.com/2017/09/best-movies-of-2017-so-far.html)

I'm excited to see the [MongoDB IPO](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/19/mongodb-mdb-ipo-stock-price-on-first-trading-day.html). I'm hoping they do well.

Also in database related things, [how discord stores billions of messages](https://blog.discordapp.com/how-discord-stores-billions-of-messages-7fa6ec7ee4c7).

The NYT released [video-transcoding-api](https://github.com/NYTimes/video-transcoding-api), an agnostic API to transcode media assets across different cloud services. Seems cool. Glad to see it open-sourced.

[How the judge on Oracle v. Google taught himself to code](https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/19/16503076/oracle-vs-google-judge-william-alsup-interview-waymo-uber) is a very good profile on a federal judge.

[Wirecutter Review: The Best Paper Towel for Mopping Up Tears](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/wirecutter-review-the-best-paper-towel-for-mopping-up-tears) made me laugh.

The Atlantic put out a poorly headlined, but interesting article on how [smartphones are affecting people in high school](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/has-the-smartphone-destroyed-a-generation/534198/).

[The War To Sell You A Mattress Is An Internet Nightmare](https://www.fastcompany.com/3065928/sleepopolis-casper-bloggers-lawsuits-underside-of-the-mattress-wars) is just fascinating.

[My Little Cluster Story](http://carolynvanslyck.com/blog/2017/10/my-little-cluster/) is a cool story and idea from @carolynvs about building your own kubernetes cluster.

[The Data Behind the Stories of Trump's Presidency](https://blog.parse.ly/post/6446/attention-data-behind-trump-stories/) has some interesting graphs.

[Meet the new Google Calendar for web](https://www.blog.google/products/g-suite/time-refresh-introducing-new-look-and-features-google-calendar-web/). I'm using it, and liking it so far.

[Experimental City: The Sci-Fi Utopia That Never Was](https://www.citylab.com/design/2017/10/experimental-city-the-sci-fi-utopia-that-never-was/543003/).

[What Are the Actual Objections to Girls in Boy Scouts?](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/10/gender-fluid-scouts/542847/) is one of the better written think pieces supporting women in the BSA.

[How to Get More People to Ride the Bus](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/10/seattle-bus-riders/543039/) is an interesting look at bus ridership in Seattle.

I really enjoyed @mattklein123's [Service mesh data plane vs. control plane](https://medium.com/@mattklein123/service-mesh-data-plane-vs-control-plane-2774e720f7fc?source=ifttt--------------1). I hadn't thought of some of the ideas he presents, and I like them a lot.

I'm excited for the LTSE, and glad to see them getting profiled in WSJ: [Can the New Long-Term Stock Exchange Disrupt Capitalism?](https://www.wsj.com/articles/silicon-valley-vs-wall-street-can-the-new-long-term-stock-exchange-disrupt-capitalism-1508151600)

One of this week's Money Stuff articles, [Black Monday and Long-Term Investors](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-10-16/black-monday-and-long-term-investors), talked about automation and system failure and when it's good to replace humans. I saw a lot of parallels to my industry, which was nice.

I read three great pieces on Github's infrastructure this week:

 - [Transit and Peering: How your requests reach GitHub](https://githubengineering.com/transit-and-peering-how-your-requests-reach-github/)
 - [Mitigating replication lag and reducing read load with freno](https://githubengineering.com/mitigating-replication-lag-and-reducing-read-load-with-freno/)
 - [Evolution of GitHubâ€™s data centers](https://githubengineering.com/evolution-of-our-data-centers/)

[Warren Buffett's "2 List" Strategy](https://jamesclear.com/buffett-focus) is a neat system. I'm not going to use it, but it matches my [100:10:1 project](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/535) from a while back. 

[at 20](http://www.ftrain.com/20.html) by @ftrain was a good read, and fun to think about how long I've been building websites. My first website launched 2003-12-13T00:20:28Z.

[Bleachers: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtkkX2f18M&feature=youtu.be) was good. I think I've shared it before, but I'm still listening to it.

[What I Learned From Reading Every Amazon Shareholders Letter](https://medium.com/@gsvpioneer/what-i-learned-from-reading-every-amazon-shareholders-letter-cdc35f309e8b?source=ifttt--------------1) was interesting, but not really surprising.

[The Fies Files: A Fire Story](https://brianfies.blogspot.com/2017/10/a-fire-story-complete.html) made me cry.

[Universal Paperclips](http://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/) absorbed most of my Saturday.


[Level Up](http://pca.st/M5u0) by [20k Hertz](https://www.20k.org/) was a good listen.

[Star Wars: The Last Jedi Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0CbN8sfihY&feature=youtu.be). Obviously.

[Have You Encountered the Softboy?](https://byrslf.co/have-you-encountered-the-softboy-7e95e2c7f3e7) & [San Francisco: now with more dystopia](https://www.mhudack.com/blog/2017/10/1/san-francisco-now-with-more-dystopia) were both good and depressing.

Finally, the latest console.fm episode, [ConsoleFM 68](https://ruby.fm/consolefm/068) was a great Fall weather listen.

Hope you have a great week.
