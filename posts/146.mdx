[Alright alright alright](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4bg4Q63kJQ)! The end of the two week break for RC. Today I powered through Noragami and went and saw [Tomorrowland](http://www.metacritic.com/movie/tomorrowland) with [Steve](https://twitter.com/ifosteve) and [John](https://jdherg.github.io/).

I also did some light planning for the next six weeks while talking to John over beers and burgers.
