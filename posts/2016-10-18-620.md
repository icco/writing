A few days late, but here is a #happy post. I spent most of last week sick. As such digging through my links was difficult since I apparently spent half the time just liking things on Twitter.

@timball sent me [Typora](https://www.typora.io/) which is "a minimal markdown reading & writing app". So far it's pretty cool, but I need to play with it more.

I have a weird love of meta Journalism articles on Journalism. NYT's article "[A Onetime BuzzFeed Wunderkind, Now at CNN](http://nyti.ms/2e5N4bb)" falls deeply in this category.

[Pokemon Go, Security, and Obsolescence](https://community.rapid7.com/community/metasploit/blog/2016/10/11/pokemon-go-security-and-obsolescence) is a nice reminder how annoying forced and planned obsolescence is.

[GitLab reinstates list of servers that have malware](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/10/15/gitlab-reinstates-list-of-servers-that-have-malware/) is an interesting article. The data it provides is a nice reminder of how many websites on the internet are compromised.

I'm slowly reading through [The Stack](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26263179-the-stack) which has been a fun read academic read on how technology could be effecting how humans interact. One thing I didn't know about that the book referenced was [PLA Unit 61398](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLA_Unit_61398), AKA [APT1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H9_xaxQHpWaa4O_Son4Gx0YOIzlcBWMsdvePFX68EKU/htmlview). This hit especially close to home as work has had me closely learning about [APT28](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fancy_Bear) and [APT29](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT29). I didn't even know about state actor level hacking groups before this job, and now I know more than I ever thought I would.

While I was doing some blog cleanup, I found ["Switching to Android"](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/496), and this month it was my sixth year since switching to a smart phone. Basically everything I predicted happened.

Two Star Wars videos:

 - [Rogue One: A Star Wars Story Trailer #2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC9abcLLQpI&feature=youtu.be) is fantastic. This movie can not happen soon enough.
 - The '[STAR WARS: The Old Republic – Knights of the Eternal Throne – "Betrayed" Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbpDxrew4A0&feature=youtu.be)' is a cool short story trailer for a game I never played and probably never will.

I discovered [twitter/secureheaders](https://github.com/twitter/secureheaders), which is an amazing Ruby gem which basically just enables all of the things you are supposed to set as a secure website these days.

"[Trump is not a team player](http://www.trumpisnotateamplayer.com/)" is a great political campaign put out by some of the people behind Cards Against Humanity. For the gamers out there, it really hits home.

[Coding Magic](http://marieflanagan.com/coding-magic/) by Marie LeBlanc Flanagan was a great read. I totally agree. Coding is weird.

[Say Cheese: a snapshot of the massive DDoS attacks coming from IoT cameras](https://blog.cloudflare.com/say-cheese-a-snapshot-of-the-massive-ddos-attacks-coming-from-iot-cameras/) is a fascinating read on how DDoS attacks are changing.


I listened to a bunch of great podcasts during my sickness, but my favorite two were:

 - [Bruce Springsteen / A Dog's Nose](http://pca.st/MMy6) on Fresh Air
 - [Giorgia Lupi](http://pca.st/U9nJ) on Design Matters with Debbie Millman

I also watched a bunch of Tiny Desk concerts:

 - [Anderson .Paak & The Free Nationals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ferZnZ0_rSM&feature=youtu.be)
 - [Blue Man Group](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTJfITfbYNA&feature=youtu.be)
 - [Margaret Glaspy](https://youtu.be/uxglzsJkBJg)
 - [Julien Baker](https://youtu.be/tADWPTqR_4A)

Finally I've been working through some albums that I'm really enjoying:

 - [Swing Lo Magellen by Dirty Projectors](http://amzn.to/2eLqN2Y)
 - [Gameshow by Two Door Cinema](http://amzn.to/2e37Ytd)
 - [Ruminations by Conor Oberst](http://amzn.to/2dXoAPu)
 - [Promised Works by The For Carnation](http://amzn.to/2e38cRg)

I hope you have a great week!
