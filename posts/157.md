Living in SF proper for two years got me seriously addicted to coffee. Every date, meeting, hangout, etc. was had over really good coffee throughout the city. Knowing that, this news still blew me away: 

 > Blue Bottle Coffee has raised another $70 million in funding, led by Fidelity Management and Research.
 > 
 > The high-end coffee shop has locations in San Francisco, New York, and Los Angeles and recently expanded to Tokyo. In April, Blue Bottle acquired Tartine Bakery, which has its own cult following in the Bay Area, to help expand into other markets.  -- [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/blue-bottle-raises-another-70-million-2015-6)

I had no idea they had acquired Tartine, which does makes amazing bread products, nor they were raising so much money. It'll be interesting to see them attempt to compete with the Starbucks and other large chains.
