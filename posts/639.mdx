Well the past few days have been... tragic. Depressing? Interesting? Unsurprising? I don't know. 

Donald Trump is an asshole doing all of the absurd hateful things he said he'd do. 25% of the US elected a white supremacist to the White House. Blargh. Let's talk about the things I've been consuming that I've been using to distract me from all this. Here we go. #happy. 2017. Whoo. 

I do something like [Box Breathing](http://quietkit.com/box-breathing/) pretty constantly. I find it's a great way to calm down. I had never really thought of it as meditation before, so I'm going to try it as a more focused attempt. Maybe then I can make it through the front page of the NYTimes without wanting to just riot.

I'm often told that I'm a morning person. I don't know how I feel about this, but [How I Became a Morning Person](http://www.extracrispy.com/culture/1979/how-i-became-a-morning-person?xid=extracrispy_socialflow_twitter) matches my general policies on dealing with the morning. 

This is one of those nice benefits of working for a gigantic company: [Google Recalls Staff to U.S. After Trump Immigration Order](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-28/google-recalls-some-staff-to-u-s-after-trump-immigration-order). Google's founders have often lent their private jets to Google employees who get stranded when crazy shit like this goes down.

I've been heavily recommending the [Google SRE book](https://landing.google.com/sre/) to everyone in the tech industry. Now it's [available for free](https://landing.google.com/sre/book/index.html)!

[OKR Fundamentals](https://medium.com/startup-tools/okrs-5afdc298bc28) by @niket is a classic. A long time ago I helped him fight through a bunch of drafts to make something everyone could understand and use. Just yesterday a friend sent it to me saying it was being passed around the office, which made me excited. It's such a great article if you're interested in OKRs. 

[The story of a designer conquering mathematics](https://blog.framer.com/a-story-of-a-designer-conquering-mathematics-d0fd4585f0ba?source=ifttt--------------1) is a fun read. I've always been horrible at math, and this article talks about a designer dealing with that feeling and working towards a stronger understanding.

[How RC uses Zulip](https://www.recurse.com/blog/112-how-rc-uses-zulip) is fun. Lots of stuff to learn here and apply to your local online communities.

Also out of a Recurse Center attendee, [Let Your Side-Project Backlog Spark Joy](http://gwendolyn.io/let-your-side-project-backlog-spark-joy/) is a great read on being productive with side projects.

[Longform Podcast 227: Jace Clayton](https://longform.org/posts/longform-podcast-227-jace-clayton) is just a fun listen if you like music journalism.

I loved Firewatch, so seeing that @hoverbird is [making a new game](https://medium.com/@hoverbird/the-soul-of-a-new-game-a8a92125bdd?source=ifttt--------------1) is super exciting.

[Ringing in 2017 with updates to our Google Voice apps](https://blog.google/products/google-voice/ringing-2017-updates-our-google-voice-apps/) is exciting as a Google Voice customer. I've been waiting for Google to show some sign that they are still maintaining Google Voice.

[Putting The Timesâ€™s First Email Address to Bed](https://nyti.ms/2k9eADZ) was a fun read of NYT history.

For a good laugh, check out "[Cards Against Humanity is hiring a CEO!](https://chicago.craigslist.org/chc/bus/5970647019.html)"

I had never seen [NYT Watching](http://www.nytimes.com/watching) before. Neat site when you're trying to figure out what you want to binge watch while you're unemployed.

I hope next week is better than this one. Best of luck out there.
