![eggs]()

Team, a few weeks ago, I decided to stop eating eggs for breakfast. There's two main reasons for this:

1. Price. A dozen large eggs is currently running around $10 here. 
2. Fear. Bird Flu is kinda freaking me out.

Historically, my breakfast for the last five or so years has been two eggs, and sometimes some toast, prepared in basically any way. I've gone through omelet phases. Hard boiled. Fried. Scrambled. With hot sauce. With Avocado. With all sorts of stuff.

That means I'm buying and consuming one carton of eggs a week at least. Money is a little tight, so while ~$520 a year isn't oppressive, it isn't nothing. 

As for bird flu, I don't know if I am being irrational or not here. But podcast episodes like [NPR Up First March 1st](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1235173135), and [Why scientists' fears about bird flu are intensifying](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1263339284 ) and articles like [CDC releases data signaling bird flu spread undetected in cows and people](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/13/nx-s1-5296672/cdc-bird-flu-study-mmwr-veterinarians) have got me concerned. 

So given all of that, I decided to stop eating eggs for breakfast.

I first tried going back to my youth and having cereal for breakfast. This did not work well. A bowl of honey nut cherries in oat milk is delicious, but with a cup of coffee, I found myself running out of energy quickly, and much more irritable than normal.

So! I reached out to the internet. I asked four communities that I feel close to and posted some variation of the following:


> Hi friends, I need some breakfast recommendations. With bird flu in the US, I'm going to change up my morning routine of two eggs, toast and coffee. 
> 
> Suggestions for other protein sources for breakfast? I can't have peanuts and I am lactose intolerant.

The communities I asked are [Merveilles.town](https://merveilles.town/@icco/114098901204873621), [Gunks Gaming Guild Discord](https://gunksgamingguild.com/), The Waystone Discord and Time Owls Discord.

Some of the responses I got (edited for clarity) included:

- Protein powder
- Some kind of grain (cereal, toast, bagel etc) and then just nomming on a piece of corned beef or sliced pork belly
- Breakfast Sausages
- Protein Muffins
- Trader Joes Protein Pancakes
- a hummus wrap with vegan protein crumbles and veggies
- Locally produced eggs are less likely to be contaminated
- [Impossible breakfast sausages](https://impossiblefoods.com/sausage/plant-based-impossible-savory-sausage-patties) in a sandwich
- Smoked salmon or other fish paired with capers and other pickled items. Can do them with sliced cucumber and a bit of hummus.
- [Just Egg](https://www.ju.st/)
- Sandwich with sliced tofu and coleslaw or fresh cabbage. salt/pepper/onions/hot sauce to taste
