Ok, week two of #tenbysix. As a reminder this project is my attempt to build ten prototypes by June. A bunch of other Recurse Center people have pledged to participate as well.

## Stuff I worked on this week:

So it was Saturday morning, and I realized I hadn't done any work on any of my projects this week. So I sat down and wrote a quick architecture plan into the README of [Creepermon](https://github.com/icco/creepermon). I then coded up a config file format and a parser for it. This is some ugly code, but the goal is to ship something quick, not necessarily pretty. Cleanup can come later.

I'm gonna shove my data into [Keen.io](https://keen.io/) because their free tier is larger than the Heroku free database (50k entries versus 10k entries). I think I'll want to scrape 10 websites, so if I scrape every ten minutes, I can store a month's worth of data per website. This isn't great, but it works. I guess eventually I'll want to host my own database of some sort.
