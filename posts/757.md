Hi there!

I have two pieces of content for you to consume:

1. [Search Engine: What should we do about teens using AI to do their homework?](https://www.searchengine.show/listen/search-engine-1/playboi-farti-and-his-ai-homework-machine)

2. [John Cleese's 1991 speech on creativity](https://youtu.be/nvKeu46jgwo?si=ozmqPq4L3hTg37HU)

Both focus on creativity in ways that inspired me. The first is a podcast investigating how different generations think about Generative AI and how it is affecting how we communicate, educate and create. The second is an older piece, focusing on how we can't create without taking the time and space to think and make things.

There's a lot of great quotes in both, and while they are long, I highly recommend a listen.

The things I took away from them and am thinking about:

- Evaluating the output of AI is where the skill comes from, if you don't know how to make the thing, you probably won't be able to know if it's any good.
- Forcing yourself to disconnect and make time longer than one hour is needed to get your brain spinning.
- Dedicated space is often useful for separating work types.
- When you don't understand something, turning it off is a common response. That's not a good way to understand it.
- Address the problem, not the solution that you don't like.
