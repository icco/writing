I've been in a bit of a funk today, but overall this week was a #happy one. My brother visited, all week, and we had fun romping around NYC.

We saw [The Revenant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Revenant_(2015_film)), which was really good.

I listened to two episodes of Design Matters which I loved [Brandon Stanton](http://designobserver.com/feature/brandon-stanton/39246/) and [Kate Bolick](http://designobserver.com/feature/kate-bolick/39249/). Both had pretty motivational things to say, and very interesting lives.

@mrmrs_ put out two fantastic pieces of writing on web design: "[CSS and Scalability](http://mrmrs.io/writing/2016/03/24/scalable-css/)" and "[The Veil of Ignorance](http://mrmrs.io/writing/2016/03/23/the-veil-of-ignorance/)".

I enjoyed [Andy Groveâ€™s Warning to Silicon Valley](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/26/opinion/andy-groves-warning-to-silicon-valley.html?action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=opinion-c-col-left-region&region=opinion-c-col-left-region&WT.nav=opinion-c-col-left-region&_r=0).

I also stumbled across [Just Fucking Build It](https://keen.io/blog/37419311398/just-fucking-build-it) by @spritz, which was good pre-reading for a hackathon I'm attending tomorrow.

I loved the artwork in [Cyberpunk Illustrations of a Dystopian Future](http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/cyberpunk-art-book-gonzales) so much, I backed the kickstarter.

"[What you think about Millennials says a lot about you, nothing about them](https://boingboing.net/2016/03/26/what-you-think-about-millennia.html)" made me laugh, and I found the whole presentation really spot-on.

@SHO_TheCircus filmed in our office, and I really liked the bonus video called [The Origin of 'Love Trumps Hate'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lssNv9vM3U&feature=youtu.be) that they put on Youtube.

Finally, I came across [thegreatestgameyouwilleverplay.com](http://thegreatestgameyouwilleverplay.com/). This website is a gorgeous dedication to one of my all time favorite games, Nethack.

I hope you have a great week!
