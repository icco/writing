Ok, so... I haven't posted in a long time. A really long time. In my defense, things that have happened since last post, in no particular order:

* Got married
* Had my 30th birthday
* Released a book
* Traveled to France
* A bunch of other small stuff

I plan on writing a post for each of those things, but until then, I just wanted to say, yes, I'm still alive.

The reason \(and it's a stupid reason\) for the lack of posts, besides being completly overwhelmed, is that I basically scrapped the old https://writing.natwelch.com and rewrote using graphql. If you're interested in participating in [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/), I've added issues to both repos:

* https://github.com/icco/graphql
* https://github.com/icco/writing

Hope you are all doing well, happy Fall.

/Nat
