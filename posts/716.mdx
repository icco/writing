In November, I left Google and started working at a startup called [Time By Ping](https://timebyping.com). There are lots of reasons I went back to startup life, and why I specifically joined TBP, but at the core of my decision was my love of [the mission: return time](https://medium.com/@ryanalshak/why-time-by-ping-ae24c7e7c1ab).

TBP holds an event on the first Friday of August called Mission Day. The company shuts down, and asks employees to find a way to return time. Some folks do volunteering work. Some take time with their families, others just spend the day relaxing.
