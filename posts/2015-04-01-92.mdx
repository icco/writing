Bam\! Another day complete. Here are a bunch of bullet points about my second day at @recursecenter.

* First priority of the was to fix [a bug](https://github.com/icco/natnatnat/commit/87c9caba355b16cc0e803f383d89db7becd78940) in my blog.
* I spent the morning reading this awesome [crazy paper about governments](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/lamport-paxos.pdf). It's the original paper for Paxos, which is a common algorithm in Distributed Systems. 
   * The paper totally made me need to read through [Wikipedia's article on math symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mathematical_symbols). 
   * I wasn't able to finish it \(because it is insane\), but I did enjoy parts.
* Took a break to help [Andrew](https://twitter.com/mrdrozdov) with some Nginx config questions, and tried and point [Libby](https://twitter.com/horrorcheck) in the right direction with her Apache questions.
* "The Paxos algorithm, when presented in plain English, is very simple." Abstract for the [simpler version of Paxos](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/paxos-simple.pdf). I was also pointed at [a visualization of Paxos](http://harry.me/blog/2014/12/27/neat-algorithms-paxos/) by Rob.
* I had a long talk with [Ken](https://twitter.com/ken_pratt) about all kinds of stuff, including how we both know Seth \(and that Seth is great people\).
* @neha walked us through Paxos, which was an interesting review of what I had read. I had originally thought of writing paper reviews of every paper I read, but this talk made me realize I didn't really understand it.
   * Maybe I also need a better reading environment at RC... it was really loud so I had trouble focusing. I wonder if there is a printer...
   * I'm not feeling up to it today, but at some point I want to work through [6\.824 Lab 3](http://nil.csail.mit.edu/6.824/2015/labs/lab-3.html). 
* I grabbed dinner at Chipotle with a bunch of people, which included conversations with [Heidi](https://twitter.com/HeidiKasemir), [Alex](https://twitter.com/ataipale), Olivia, [Agustin](https://twitter.com/agustinbenassi) and [Gon√ßalo](https://twitter.com/gnclmorais).
* After dinner I read through [Prim's Algorithm on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%!s%28MISSING)\_algorithm\), and [this javascript implementation](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/11159599) of it. I also watched [The Scythian \- Positive Female Characters in Video Games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXmj2yJNUmQ&feature=youtube_gdata), which was fantastic.

Things to maybe look into later:

* http://blog.acolyer.org/2015/03/01/cant\-we\-all\-just\-agree/
* http://angus.nyc/writing/paxos\-by\-example/
* Building a volume indicator for RC. Maybe a nice visual way to tell if it's crazy loud in the main room.
