Ok, I won't lie to you, I lost a lot of time today to reading about Google I/O and discussing it with people. Sadly none of Google's announcements promissed a way to lower device turnover. We're still gonna have to buy a new device every year if we want the newest version of Android. It's realities like this that make me want to move to Apple devices, no matter how much better Android is.

Another thing that took up a bunch of my time was @alexbaldwin telling me [my wallpaper site](http://walls.natwelch.com) wasn't showing up in Google. This led me down a rabbit hole because my site was running slow, running on a deprecated Heroku stack, and I had a bunch of wallpapers to finish making in my queue.

What I really wanted to do today, was build [Meet](http://github.com/icco/meet). I got started, in that I got basic OAuth with RC working. Now I just need to get all of the functionality besides auth working. The idea is a site that matches you with someone else in RC every day, so you get to know everyone in the space. If it works well, then I hope to start matching alumni as well.

I also spent some time thinking about [Go Challenge 4](http://golang-challenge.com/go-challenge4/).

I presented some of the work I've been doing on my blog since I got to RC, which led to an interesting discussion with [Yuta](https://twitter.com/kenzan100).

Chris presented his awesome project [gittorrent](https://github.com/cjb/GitTorrent) (link is useless), and said something at the end that really got me thinking: Why aren't we building more ambitious projects that only require users and their tools, and not funding to build.

After talks, I wandered a bit and then saw [Mad Max](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Max:_Fury_Road). It was good, although not too surprising. 

On my way home I wandered past the WTC and checked out the memorial from a distance (it's closed at night). Then stumbled past Zuccotti Park and Wall st. I took some pictures, but @Flickr is being stupid, so I'll try uploading them in the morning.
