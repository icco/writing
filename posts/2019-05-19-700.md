Travel day\! 

On our fourthday, Melissa and I traveled via Shinkansen \(bullet train\) from Shinagawa Station \(Tokyo\) to Shin\-Osaka Station \(Osaka\). We didn't get many photos of this, but we bought some bento boxes, loaded ourselves and luggage onto a train, and we were off\!

We saw my brother Travis very briefly \(he stopped by the hotel while running errands\). Got a massage at the hotel. Then we ended our day with an omakase Tempura meal. This was unique and quite good.
