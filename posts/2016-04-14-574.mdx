Ok, so last weekend I totally failed on getting a post out on time. So much so that the following week is almost over... So here's a look back into the past on what's making me #happy.

[T.J. Miller Has a Seizure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf9N5AWprG8&feature=youtu.be) is an interesting take on a really scary life story told in a humerous way.

[Man reads books with fake covers on subway](https://boingboing.net/2016/04/07/man-reads-books-with-fake-cove.html) made me laugh.

The [ROGUE ONE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wji-BZ0oCwg) trailer is out. Let the hype train begin.

Three words I did not entirely expect together: [flying chainsaw drone](http://www.theverge.com/2016/4/4/11359828/flying-chainsaw-drone-finland).

The Atlantic did a pretty good write up on "[What Are the Panama Papers?](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/04/what-are-the-panama-papers/476658/)". This was a huge thing, and I'm expecting the ramifications of the Panama Papers to continue to be large.

Anyways, sorry it's so short. I probably listened to some good podcasts too or something...
