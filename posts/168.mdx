Only ten more days... [sadnat.com](http://sadnat.com).

I continued my work from Sunday, rewriting how [my mood board](http://mood.natwelch.com) serves data. You can [kind of get an idea of what I'm doing in the pull request](https://github.com/icco/inspiration/pull/1/files). Basically instead of hitting every servers twice (once asking for what the content of the link is, a second time for the image), I'll have the first request cached, and just ask for the image. It's not working yet, but progress.

I found a bug in [swish](https://github.com/jeremyw/swish) and submitted two ([1](https://github.com/jeremyw/swish/pull/12), [2](https://github.com/jeremyw/swish/pull/11)) pull requests to fix the bugs I found.

I did not help Kamal with CSS and prototyping. I'll need to get to that tomorrow.

I did help Steve with golang templates. That was fun.

I started on my path to [write something every day](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/167) after RC.

I took a long walk with @nicholasbs, trying to get a handle on whether or not NYC is the right city for me.

We had a great talk by @nathanmarz on Clojure and his [specter](https://github.com/nathanmarz/specter) project.
