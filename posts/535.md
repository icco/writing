OK, so, I made this resolution to try building things using the [100:10:1](https://blog.fogus.me/2015/11/04/the-100101-method-my-approach-to-open-source/) pattern. So here is a list of one hundred ideas of things I could build out. Note that throughout this post, I could easily replace the words "web site" with "app" and vice versa. The things listed below have no promise of being good ideas, just ideas.

 * A web site for promoting building things in two month stints, ala Strip Search
 * A web site for sharing project ideas to inspire people
 * Another TODO website
 * An RSS reader focused on giving you five articles a day that you have to read
 * A meal planning and sharing site
 * A Sinatra-esque task queue
 * A service focused on making it easy for people to create and host static sites
 * A Javascript story game, kind of like something telltale would make
 * An OKR website
 * An online dictionary that imitates the ease of access of a normal dictionary
 * A project idea generator
 * A site that teaches you one random thing a day
 * A slack bot that shares all of the blog posts and tweets and photos members of a slack make

 * A website for sharing playlists
 * A Heroku clone
 * Given a Soundcloud playlist, generate a Youtube video

 * A site that scrapes all of your social media and gives you a historical look at what you did on a day by day basis
 * A simple monitoring app that takes a list of URLs and starts monitoring them over time.
 * A lock server built on top of the block chain
 * A good voice recorder for Android
 * A web indexer and crawler
 * A personal internet archive
 * A mail box flood website. Give us money and an address, and we'll send them mail with exponentially more mail over time until the mail runs out.
 * Give an address and $2, get a generated piece of art in the mail
 * Poetry generator
 * College admission essay generator
 * Implement NTP client in Javascript
 * Code review tool with genius.com type annotating
 * A version of hound.ci that sends pull requests to fix issues
 * A bot net that joins IRC channels and starts having discussions arguing about politics and religion at the level of drunk high school students
 * A site that acts as a virus to share all episodes ever published of essential mix
 * A dating app with no pictures or demographic information
 * A matrix type message board that is completely anonymous

 * A site that summarizes movies by the colors they use

 * A book sharing website. Like a library but online
 * A site for sharing timelines
