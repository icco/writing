Blargh\. Monday. I failed to write anything. [sadnat.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20240522150946/https://sadnat.com:443/) to the max. So tonight you get two days for the price of one\!

On Monday I was feeling that I wasn't getting anything done. By the end of Tuesday, that feeling had disappeared. I think it's entirely due to not coding. It was advised when our batch started that you should try and write some code every day. I had been ignoring that advice, and now I realize that was a huge mistake. Another theory is that writing daily snapshots might be causing me to focus on a period of time too small to notice progress. But I think I'm going to continue writing these for now, I enjoy them.

On Day 20 \(about one fifth of my time in NYC, one day into week three of twelve of RC\) I spent most of the day chatting with [Ken](https://twitter.com/ken_pratt) about two week long Go projects we could do together. We talked about games, visualizations, real time data processing, all kinds of stuff. After talking to [Mary](https://twitter.com/maryrosecook), we ended up on a multiplayer asteroids. This has a lot of interesting problems, particularly [client-side prediction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client-side_prediction). So on Day 20, we set up our deployment environment and got our repo set up. That filed about two hours, and then we headed over to the Monday Night Talk. 

The talk was in a new location with [a gorgeous view](https://web.archive.org/web/20190115173132/https://www.flickr.com/photos/icco/16934408727/). The talk was by @r0ml, whom had a lot of interesting ideas to propose to us about the future of programming and computing. I didn't take any notes, but [Luna has a fantastic summary](https://lunacodes.wordpress.com/2015/04/14/r0ml-talk-notes-the-third-age-of-computing-immutability/). @r0ml recommended we all read [A Handbook of Software and Systems Engineering](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3414919-a-handbook-of-software-and-systems-engineering), which I can't find an ebook copy of, so who knows if I'll ever consume it, but sounds interesting.

On Tuesday \(Day 21\), Ken and I spent the day coding [Hyperspace](http://playhyperspace.com). I focused on making the frontend javascript game, and Ken focused on creating the backend. I didn't take any videos of multiplayer \(which Ken got a basic version of working\) just because I didn't have enough hands, but I got a bunch of progress Vines throughout the day:

Just [making as much progress as we did](https://github.com/kenpratt/hyperspace/compare/f16a8701b6d0f11d2f978935ed51054184d6321c...ae07e59b892bd8aae2d8ccf7815d1722f4fe7ca3) made me super happy, so hopefully it continues\!
