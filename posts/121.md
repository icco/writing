I spent all of Monday working with Ken to finish up Hyperspace, our multiplayer asteroids clone. We presented it Monday night in front of a bunch of alumni and current recursers, and it was well received.

[Steve](https://twitter.com/ifosteve) suggested we summarize our learnings in a blog post, which seems like a good idea. Now on to find the next project!
