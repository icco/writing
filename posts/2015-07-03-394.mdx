Thursday, July 2nd, 2015: Last day of RC! 

First, some house keeping: It really bothers me that we had 47 days of RC and not 48. This is because we had one Monday off for Memorial day. I generally don't like odd numbers, I'm not sure where this came from, but I'll power through.

Caroline reminded me yesterday that the first of July is the begining of the third quarter of the year. So I archived my second quarter playlist (which really didn't get much love) and today I started building my [third quarter playlist](https://itunes.apple.com/us/playlist/q3y15-summer-time/idpl.ec290fda8528440783dc918fd0d730ea) (I've never linked to an iTunes playlist... but in theory you can listen to this if you click it on anything with a new version of iTunes or an iPhone). I started building these playlists after working with @saturnial one day, and seeing that he did it. I liked the idea, and have been doing it ever since. Some quarters become "Albums I have obtained recently and like" and others are "here are a bunch of songs around a theme". This summer I'm going with a theme of "Summer" and we shall see how it goes. It needs to be structured like my summer days, chill during the day, high energy in the morning and night.

Anyways, the day started off with a nice little walk to RC. Being twenty minutes away by foot is amazing. I showed up for RC full of energy and exuberance. I wish every day of RC could have been like this. After I arrived, I got this message from Ken.

He was pointing at me from across the room, but sadly was not in an "Uncle Sam" outfit. We had a good last checkin group together (every Monday through Thursday at 10:30, everyone at RC gets into groups of six and discusses their plans).

I dicked around on the internet for a while, and then we went on an excurion to get pizza from [Juliana's Pizza](http://www.julianaspizza.com/) in Brooklyn. It was really good.

When we got back, I somehow got onto a 90's kick, and started listening to [Tonight, Tonight](http://genius.com/Smashing-pumpkins-tonight-tonight-lyrics/) by the Smashing Pumpkins.

While listening to the 90s, I started figuring out how to importing all of my old blog posts from [tumble](https://github.com/icco/tumble). I was greatly succesful, and now you'll see a nice list of all the old posts, and a huge gap where I didn't blog at all, on the archives.

Downside is that post Ids are no longer related to time posted.

Afterwards, I went for a brief walk, and then we had presentations. John and I talked about our [Recurser Social Directory](https://rsd.herokuapp.com). You can't view it if you aren't at RC, but we're hoping it makes the community better.

After presentations, we had a nice going away talk and then took a photo.

I need to go through my photos to clean up the still shots and find the best one, but here is an animation of us playing around.

After the photo we partied!

I will write up a return statement once I know how to sort through all of these feelings, until then, I'll just keep on recursing.
