First off, [Trevor Something's Death Dream](https://trevorsomething.bandcamp.com/album/death-dream) has been my album to the week. More proof that sad things make me #happy.

I'm not sure why, but  The New York Times [review of "The Big Short"](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/11/movies/review-in-the-big-short-economic-collapse-for-fun-and-profit.html) killed me. The review was generally hilarious and made me want to see the film.

I grew up with my mom showing me comics in [The New Yorker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Yorker), so the comic [Not from the New Yorker](https://thenib.com/not-from-the-new-yorker-28f533a36895) was hilarious

I enjoyed [5 Hidden Gems of the Ruby Standard Library by Sergio Gil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL-zPihYWBc&feature=youtu.be) partially for the pun in the title, and because I hadn't heard of one of the things he mentioned.

I'm not a huge Conan fan, but [Secret Santa Conan Blows His Staffer's Mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBeakKeMWRY&feature=youtu.be) made me laugh pretty hard.

Wow, according to [State of the Commons 2015](https://stateof.creativecommons.org/2015/) more than 1.1 billion works are now under one of the CC licenses, CC0, or the public domain mark. So cool. 

I had never read this [Slate article about Larry Page](http://www.slate.com/blogs/business_insider/2014/04/25/google_s_larry_page_the_co_founder_s_untold_story.html) which was pretty interesting.

And everybody loves videos of things being made, like [this one of Valve's Steam Controller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCgnWqoP4MM).

Next week, I imagine I'll get lost in all of the top ten year end lists. NPR and Pitchfork are already starting to put out theirs, but I've been ignoring so far. I feel like I'm forgetting something... but oh well. Have a great week!
