I spent most of Monday restructuring my Code Words article on DDoS. Slowly things are coming together. 

I also had a bunch of notifications on Github for Fog, but [only one](https://github.com/fog/fog-google/pull/44) required anything from me. I do like pull requests, I just show up, read some code, and then click a button.

In the evening, we had a talk by [Frank Wang](http://frankwang.org/). Interesting discussion on the future of data storage cryptography. I ran out before the Q&A so I could grab drinks with Courtney.
