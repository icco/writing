Damn, I just posted [What's making me happy 2016-09-20](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/610) and totally forgot to add in a fantastic post by @jongold.

I totally missed it when he first posted it, but I read "[Taking The Robots To Design School, Part 1](http://jon.gold/2016/05/robot-design-school/)" recently  and it's absolutly fantastic and fascinating. It's a great look at Typography, how you break down a problem, and how to never stop learning.

So thanks @jongold for the fantastic piece.
