While [artgrabber](/posts/767) was a success of AI coding me a discord bot, `genidi` was a drastic failure during #decemberadventure.

In 2026, I want to make a lot more music. Two areas where I really want to explore are composing, [MIDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI) and sequencing. I feel I have sound creation down, but putting those sounds together to make songs and compositions is not something I understand. So for my last #decemberadventure I figured I'd try and make a midi generator for the command line I could use. I wanted it to be like babies first midi. I wanted it to tell me what was happening over the wire that was going from my computer to a [mmMidi](https://busycircuits.com/pages/alm023) which then went to my smaller Eurorack system.

I wanted the code to be in Go and run on the cli. I wanted it to be a simple eight step sequencer. Each step should send an envelope (basically a voltage that defines what volume of the note is), and a note (A, B, C etc.). I also needed to define a clock signal, basically how fast the sequencer moved to the next step.

I decided to use Cursor's new Agent mode to generate this. The code it created is at [icco/genidi](https://github.com/icco/genidi). It did not create anything that worked. Some pieces it generated worked, mostly some of the UI, but it did not do the following:

1. Properly send Midi
2. Generate steps as I wanted

So now I've started fixing the code and am heavily debating rewriting from scratch. That will be a project for January.
