Here's a set of #videos of interviews with #kanye for the Time 100. 

* [Kanye West on Why He Doesn't Care About His Legacy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yd2V68HUlYs&feature=youtu.be)
* [Kanye West on Why He's Not in a Competition With Anyone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Goood8R6Zjo&feature=youtu.be)
* [Kanye West on Being The Robin Hood of Fashion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKXqrPRECG0&feature=youtu.be)


@helloxander got me truly addicted to Kanye a long time back. I've loved his music since a friend gave me a copy of [Graduation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduation_%28album%29) in college. Hilariously, it was another year or so before I saw the [video for Stronger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsO6ZnUZI0g) and realized Kanye shared my love for Japan and Anime.

If you liked these interviews, [the 2015 Time 100](http://time.com/collection/2015-time-100/) came out a few months ago and is worth a quick skim.
