It's June! A #happy post, on time and in the can.

First, two music mix podcast episodes from the great @alexbaldwin:

 - [Trash Panda](https://ruby.fm/alexbaldwin/trash-panda)
 - [Console.FM #065](https://ruby.fm/consolefm/065)

Alex also introduced me to "Binging with Babish", my new favorite cooking youtube channel:

 - [Binging with Babish: World's Greatest Sandwich from Spanglish - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_l8_C-EO38&feature=youtu.be)
 - [Binging with Babish: Eggs Woodhouse for Good - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVgmI-YF16g&feature=youtu.be)
 - [Binging with Babish: Bob's Burgers - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=basFyoMSjds&feature=youtu.be)
 - [Binging with Babish: Rick & Morty Szechuan Sauce - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBhhlE92mIQ&feature=youtu.be)

[Buzzfeed did a Tom Hanks + The Intercept shoutout](https://www.buzzfeed.com/shylawatson/tom-hanks-is-confused-by-this-ny-building-and-tbh-so-are-we?ref=bffbmain#.ffNALD9X1).

I hadn't heard of [Gandi Domains](https://www.gandi.net/) before, but they are playing around with `.xyz`: [Introducing the 1.111B Class of .xyz domains](https://news.gandi.net/en/2017/06/introducing-the-1-111b-class-of-xyz-domains/)

This is the one of the more sad tech job stories I've heard in awhile: [Accidentally destroyed production database on first day of a job](https://np.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6ez8ag/accidentally_destroyed_production_database_on/). This CTO should be fired.

Been meaning to figure this out for a while, now I know: [Montreal-Style vs. New York-Style Bagels](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/02/montreal-bagels_n_5247880.html).

[Maciej Cegłowski, Pinboard - XOXO Festival (2013)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eky5uKILXtM&feature=youtu.be) is a solid talk. Thanks to @jonbuda for suggesting it.

@dmpatierno turned me on to @matt_levine's writing a few months ago, and this week he had two posts that made me laugh particularly hard:

 - [Multiplication, Gaming and Writing](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-06-01/multiplication-gaming-and-writing)
 - [Cat Funds and Cooking IPOs](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-06-02/cat-funds-and-cooking-ipos)

Speaking of economics, two good bitcoin reads this week:

 - [The Rise of Cryptocurrency Ponzi Schemes](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/05/cryptocurrency-ponzi-schemes/528624/)
 - [Getting Hacked, Lessons Learned](http://avc.com/2017/06/getting-hacked-lessons-learned/)

I cooked [Crab Fried Rice](http://thewoksoflife.com/2015/06/crab-fried-rice/) but used a cast iron skillet and chicken, and it turned out really well. Would recommend.

[Why do so few people major in computer science?](http://danwang.co/why-so-few-computer-science-majors/?idk) is an interesting question and it does perplex me. 

[The Place Where Letters To Hillary Clinton Go](https://www.buzzfeed.com/rubycramer/the-place-where-letters-to-hillary-clinton-go#.ncvRNNkPq) is a fun read and me miss @hfa.

[Why Facts Don’t Change Our Minds](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/02/27/why-facts-dont-change-our-minds?mbid=social_twitter) is just depressing.

I love Destiny, so was excited to read [Destiny 2: What we know](https://www.polygon.com/2017/5/20/15659696/destiny-2-gameplay-livestream-news-pc-ps4-xbox-one) by Polygon. Not enough to convince me to preorder yet... but I'm getting there.

From the time "[The Coat of Arms Said ‘Integrity.’ Now It Says ‘Trump.’](https://nyti.ms/2saErz7)" killed me. Trump is just such a dick.

I love the [Stoner Podcast](http://www.stoner.co/), and [Episode 08: Alexandra Chasin](http://pca.st/42s4) was a fascinating listen to the history of Marijuana regulation.

Have a great week!
