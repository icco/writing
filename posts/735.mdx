Here's me trying to get two #happy posts out in one month! It was my birthday last week. I had a great time, but a few days later as a late birthday present, I got norovirus from the Earth. Feeling better now, but yay!

TV & Movies

-  I rewatched all of [Ted Lasso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Lasso) while recovering, so that was fun. Show holds up.
-  I started watching [Metallic Rouge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallic_Rouge). It's by the illustrious [Studio Bones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bones_(studio)), and so far it's beautiful and completely inscrutable.
-  [F1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One) is back this weekend, as is [Drive to Survive Season 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_1:_Drive_to_Survive#Season_6_(2024)). So far DTS has been fantastic. It's just a reality show about rich people and its absurdity is wonderful. Excited for the racing to begin again.

Music

- Got a few records as gifts for my birthday, which I've been slowly listening through. I had forgotten how amazing [Syro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syro) and [There Is Love in You](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_Is_Love_in_You) are.

Read

- [HDMI Forum Rejects Open-Source HDMI 2.1 Driver Support Sought By AMD](https://www.phoronix.com/news/HDMI-2.1-OSS-Rejected) made me incredibly angry. I know this is supposed to be happy posts, but the only reason I'm happy is that there are people willing to fight for years (this attempt was 3+ years in the making) to try and make sure open source works for all.
- I started [The Atlas Complex](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/63104676-the-atlas-complex). So far it's well written but very confusing, not sure if I'll finish.

Play

- I started playing [Slay the Spire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slay_the_Spire). Lots of fun, and has a good gameplay loop. I've been playing on PS5, but it's on a lot of the platforms.
