So I've been listening to [Reply All](https://gimletmedia.com/show/reply-all/) for a while, and I love it. The show is thoughtful and silly. Often providing insight into interesting parts of the internet I had never heard about.

But with [Episode 36](https://gimletmedia.com/episode/36-todays-the-day/), the show reached a turning point. They seem to be doing stuff now where they start doing research for a show and then just go on weird fucking adventures. [Episode 44](https://gimletmedia.com/episode/44-shine-on-you-crazy-goldman/) was part two in that strain of things. I hope it continues.
