Back at the grind after a wonderful week off in the Bahamas. I got sick for a few days after getting home, but still #happy so can't complain. Lots of traveling in the coming weeks: Headed to SF tomorrow for a few days. Then London on the 11th for a few days as well!


Watch

 - Melissa and I have been on a bit of animated movie kick lately. We watched Shrek, Tangled, and Zootopia. All hold up realy well and are a delight to watch.

Listen

 - [Chet Faker @ TheLotRadio 01-29-2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT8i4E4NYXs) is a great set of unreleased music from him. Very chill listening.
 - [Can you patent a pizza?](https://gastropod.com/can-you-patent-a-pizza/) is a great episode of Gastropod about the history of stuffed crust pizza and the patenting of food.
 - [Decoder interview with Bluesky CEO Jay Graber](https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/25/24108872/bluesky-ceo-graber-federation-social-media-decoder-interview) is a great interview and made me want to investigate Bluesky and their AT protocol more.

Read

 - Caught up on my manga this week. Read the latest volumes of [Spy x Family](https://www.viz.com/spy-x-family), [Call of the Night](https://www.viz.com/call-of-the-night), and [Blue Lock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Lock). They aren't perfect, but they are all fun reads.

Play

 - I tried out [F1 23](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_23) and boy is it terrible. It was free on PlayStation, so I tried it out. Not for me. So for now I'll continue working on Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Libery and Baulder's Gate 3.

I hope you have a great week!
