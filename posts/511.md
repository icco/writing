After a [very straight forward talk](http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/916) showcasing all of the data on the internet that has been lost in the last few years, I've been spending the day thinking about what I need to change. Here is a list of my next steps, I think.

 1. Get a simple version of [NatTape](https://github.com/icco/nattape) out. iTunes Match and Google Music are losing and breaking my playlists.
 2. Finish moving natwelch.com, pseudoweb.net and a few other small sites to AWS or a comparable cloud.
 3. Switch cloud server to Nginx.
 4. Backup all photos on Flickr. Automate and cron.
 5. Backup all posts on Twitter, G+, Facebook and related conversations. Automate and cron.
 6. Automate backup of all code on Github and Gists.
 7. Rebuild home backup server.
 8. Mirror all remote backups locally.
 9. Backup Music and clean out library.
 10. Backup Videos and clean out and organize library.
 11. Build alerting system to verify stability of backups.
 12. Build similar tool to @t to post on one site and have it share outwardly.

Note to self, a little more explanation for the public might be useful here...
