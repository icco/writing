These two posts make me think about how we create. 

The article about iOS7 states that "culture is a closed loop feedback system that edits itself with the passage of time", which I believe to be incredibly true. I've found just about everything I've ever done has been on the basis of absorbing, combining, tweaking and then outputting. Creative vomit if you will.

Expanding that culture is just what the majority of us hear and interpret is not too hard to believe then. 

The Kick-starter article then shows us that a lot of the moving and shaking in the regurgitation process comes from figuring out what that's been ingested is most important, or what takes hold of our consciousness the most.
