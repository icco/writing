It has been a long time since a #happy post. So long apparently that I broke tag lookup on my blog and I didn’t notice. The last thing looking like a happy post was called [the nat index](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/704) which lasted all of one post. So today, I decided I would bring back my weekly posts.

\
Two IRL things that are making me happy is my mom is visiting, and I went to a Nets game last week!

In media, I’ve been on a strong anime kick this season, because this season has been amazing! I tweeted some of these out already, but I’ll make a list of what I’m watching:

* [Vivy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivy:_Fluorite_Eye%27s_Song)
* [86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/86_(novel_series))
* [ODDTAXI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odd_Taxi)
* [Fruit’s Basket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruits_Basket_(2019_TV_series))
* [Tokyo Revengers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Revengers)
* [Megalobox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megalobox)

I keep posting what I watch on https://anilist.co/user/icco/ if you want to follow along.

\
In interesting and/or fun links:

* [Return to Office: Employees Are Quitting Instead of Giving Up Work From Home](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-01/return-to-office-employees-are-quitting-instead-of-giving-up-work-from-home) - I love this. I went fully remote during the pandemic, and I don’t think I could ever go back.
* I’ve been getting back into making electronic music, something I haven’t played with since 2014. In particular, I’ve been focusing on doing things that don’t require a laptop or a DAW. [The 12 best affordable, pocket-sized, hackable synthesizers](https://www.factmag.com/2017/07/22/best-affordable-small-hackable-open-source-synthesizers/) was a fun list to read through to think about things to build to keep building in this area.
* I’ve been loving [Mythic Quest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythic_Quest) over the pandemic, and with Season 2 coming out [Rob McElhenney on Getting High with Snoop Dogg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joKpcx5hRJo) was a fun interview to watch.


Anyways! Hope you’re doing well.
