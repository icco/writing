Ah, almost forgot to write Day 51... whoops.

I started the day with a long brunch at [Baz](http://bazbagel.com/). Then I spent a bunch of the day writing my article for [Code Words](https://codewords.recurse.com/issues).

I took a break at 14:30 to pair with Steve on writing Go tests for his URL shortener for an hour, which was fun.

In the evening, we had presentations and went to [Barcade](http://barcadestmarks.com/).
