Inspiration is a tricky thing. From what I can tell, I get most inspired by any human creation. Whether it's a song, a photograph, a painting or a website, pretty things get me thinking. What I also find interesting is how some choose to inspire. Some throw a ton of pics on a page, others make a moving speech, others send their favorite articles by email.

I hope this site turns into my way to inspire you.
