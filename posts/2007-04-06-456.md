The Apple TV has <a href="http://www.appletvhacks.net/2007/04/01/mac-os-x-running-on-apple-tv/">been hacked</a>. You can now run the full mac OSX on it, plus enable USB and add functionality to <a href="http://www.appletvhacks.net/2007/04/02/create-plugins-for-backrow/">frontrow</a> You can even <a href="http://www.appletvhacks.net/2007/03/24/enable-ssh-and-afp-on-your-apple-tv/">enable SSH</a>.

But what is making this whole thing amazing is the fact that <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/04/05/apple-not-fighting-back-against-apple-tv-hacks/">Apple doesn't care</a>. I mean there have been a lot of smart and dumb moves in terms of hacking hardware, and this is definitely one of the smarter ones. I feel that this device may flop, but still it has potential.

And while this is all very cool, what is the best news is that companies are starting to release <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/03/technology/03music.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin">unencrypted versions of their songs on the iTunes music store.</a>  Possible in a response to <a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughtsonmusic/">Steve Jobs letter </a>proclaiming the DRM  music was the reason for low sales of music. I am really excited for this, because the more open standards, the more chances we have.
