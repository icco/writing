Hi team! Sorry for taking so long to get one of these up. I tend to remember that I didn't write one on Wednesday... and I feel weird posting these on weekdays. Not sure why, but it's true.

So here is a new #happy post! With all the sad news out there, hopefully, this will keep you distracted for a little bit.


[When Your Uber Driver Brings a Time Machine](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/style/modern-love-when-your-uber-driver-brings-a-time-machine.html?smid=tw-nytstyles&smtyp=cur&_r=0) was just a beautiful modern love piece about finding closure. Well written and interesting to think about how we're all connected.

[How to Tie a Tie](http://www.esquire.com/style/advice/a25665/how-to-tie-a-tie-easy/). I don't wear ties often (I've worn a tie to less than ten events in my life), and I needed to wear one last night. So this was the article that ended up reminding me how to tie one.


[sindresorhus/speed-test](https://github.com/sindresorhus/speed-test): Test your internet connection speed and ping using speedtest.net from the CLI. Seems neat, given how annoying the regular speed test sites are. I just kind of wish the install method wasn't npm. The tool looks like it would be a  great tool to be written in Go, but alas.

[Neapolitan Pizza Star Anthony Mangieri Confirms His 2018 Return to New York](https://ny.eater.com/platform/amp/2017/11/10/16633652/una-pizza-napoletana-nyc-opening-plan). I'm excited. Had his pizza in SF, and it was great.

[The Queen of the Skies: Our iconic Boeing 747 through the years](http://view.ceros.com/united/747-queen-skies-farewell-mb/p/14) is a neat little history site on the 747 by United Airlines.

I just started listening to [Dissect](https://dissectpodcast.com/), which analyzes one album per season. What I've heard so far has been great. Thanks to @pmocampo for sharing with me!

[Come to RC for a one-week retreat](https://www.recurse.com/blog/121-come-to-rc-for-a-one-week-retreat) is a neat experiment by @recursecenter. Excited to see how it turns out.

The first story of Money Stuff's [Yield Curves and Market Color](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-11-10/yield-curves-and-market-color) describes and summarises an article from my work, [Leaked Documents Expose Plan to Wage Financial War on Qatar](https://theintercept.com/2017/11/09/uae-qatar-oitaba-rowland-banque-havilland-world-cup/). It's a pretty wild article, and fun read.

The @hfa Digital team is putting out some [great one-year retrospectives on Medium](https://medium.com/hillary-for-america-digital-one-year-later). I recommend reading them all, but my two favorites were:

 - [We ran a yearlong media start-up to tell the story of the election that no one else would tell](https://medium.com/hillary-for-america-digital-one-year-later/we-ran-a-yearlong-media-start-up-to-tell-the-story-of-the-election-that-no-one-else-would-tell-1b93583b0281?source=ifttt--------------1)
 - [I tweeted for Hillary Clinton for a year and a half. I learned some things.](https://medium.com/hillary-for-america-digital-one-year-later/i-tweeted-for-hillary-clinton-for-a-year-and-a-half-i-learned-some-things-9fb952076f25?source=ifttt--------------1)


[Debug Better By Throwing Information Away](https://honeycomb.io/blog/2017/11/debug-better-by-throwing-information-away/) was interesting because of the idea of dynamic sampling of events. Not something I had thought of (stop sampling when there are events you care about).

@mel_cantrell and I got lost in a Wikipedia rabbit hole about old companies. Two companies I didn't know about which I enjoyed reading about were [Kongō Gumi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kong%C5%8D_Gumi) and [Otis Elevator Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otis_Elevator_Company).

[chia.network](https://chia.network/) looks interesting. TechCrunch describes it in [BitTorrent inventor announces eco-friendly bitcoin competitor Chia](https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/08/chia-network-cryptocurrency/).

I love timezones and the history of time because of the pure humanity of it all. Two articles on the topic came out due to the time change in the US:

 - [Clocks Turn Back Sunday, but Some States Wish They Wouldn’t](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/12/us/spring-forward-daylight-savings-time.html)
 - [Why do we turn our clocks back? A history of daylight saving time.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2017/11/04/termination-of-chaos-how-daylight-saving-solved-americas-clock-craziness/?sw_bypass=true)

[With Virginia, Voters Give Democrats First Big Wins of the Trump Era](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/us/politics/virginia-election-democrats.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=a-lede-package-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news). A lot of my friends from the campaign worked on these races, and I'm glad to see it all paid off.

[Star Wars x Rag & Bone Is the Stylish Movie Merch We've Been Waiting For](https://www.gq.com/story/star-wars-rag-and-bone-collection). I wish this weren't such a limited release.

[Who’s Sitting Next to You on the Subway?](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/10/whos-sitting-next-to-you-on-the-subway-we-asked.html) was just a nice walk through peoples lives.

Time magazine put out a list of [women](https://thehustle.co/part-2-10-amazing-entrepreneurs-who-had-accomplished-nothing-by-age-30) and [men](https://amp.timeinc.net/fortune/2016/02/23/entrepreneurs-accomplished-nothing-age-30) who had done nothing at age 30 but then did lots of very successful things later on, and this made me feel good.

[How iFixit Became King of the iPhone Teardown](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/7x4wxx/ifixit-iphone-x-teardown-behind-the-scenes). Yay @ifixit and @kwiens!

Some great music:

 - [Japanese Breakfast: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK4gaJwXw_4&feature=youtu.be)
 - [Thundercat: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhVgbZdMdb0&feature=youtu.be)
 - [Björk: The Gate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n0Ps1KWVU0&feature=youtu.be)


[SRE, Security, and Presidential Campaigns - DevOpsDays Boston 2017](http://confreaks.tv/videos/devopsdaysboston2017-sre-security-and-presidential-campaigns) is an excellent recording of some of my favorite people from 2016 talking about tech on the campaign.

[Glaciers](http://www.stfj.net/index2.php?year=2016&project=art/2016/Glaciers) is just cool art.

xkcd's [Digital Resource Lifespan](https://xkcd.com/1909/) is an excellent reminder that storage and archival is hard and important.

Hope you have a great week!
