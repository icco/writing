Sunday\.

Some Recursers \(RCers? Hackers? People?\) planned an Eastover potluck brunch at the Recurse Center. I attended and it was a blast. After eating a lot of delicious food, a few of us played [Werewolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_%28party_game%29) for like six hours. It was a nice break from thinking about computers.
