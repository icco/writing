I spent Saturday at the [Soundscapes Music Hackathon](https://web.archive.org/web/20241006205907/https://monthlymusichackathon.org/post/115585146087/soundscapes). It was interesting, and a well run event, but I just didn't know enough music stuff to quickly hack something together that I wanted to present.

I spent most of the day chatting with @LourdesZapata and @stellagram1, while I coded up [starscape](https://web.archive.org/web/20250528204554/https://github.com/icco/starscape/blob/gh-pages/index.html). It doesn't really work, but the idea was to take data from http://data.nasa.gov and try and turn it into music. This is still a concept I'm interested in, so maybe next week I'll iterate on the idea more at RC.

Some interesting things I learned about from the talks though:

 - [NYC Electroacoustic Music Festival](https://web.archive.org/web/20241114021116/https://nycemf.org/)
 - [Micahel Musick](https://michaelmusick.com/) presented his sonic space research, which really reminded me of [DAYLAY](https://web.archive.org/web/20231207142508/https://www.exploratorium.edu/visit/outdoor-gallery/daylay), an exhibit I saw a while ago in SF.
 - [citygram](http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/marl/research/citygram) sounds like it has a lot of cool data.
