Today, Ken and I talked more about the [the Valve paper](https://web.archive.org/web/20250424004039/https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Latency_Compensating_Methods_in_Client/Server_In-game_Protocol_Design_and_Optimization) I linked yesterday. Both of us are confused, but we started to get server synced flying and shooting working despite our confusion.

Lots of bugs, but we think we can get it done by next Thursday.

Last night I went to Megan's birthday, which was a blast. Met a ton of interesting people. I have no idea how to describe [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) to people though. I try a different way every time, and every time no one gets it.
