Last week was pretty busy with the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday, and then lots of things breaking at work on the following days. That being said, I still found reasons to be #happy!

On Friday afternoon, I was given a tour of [Grand Central Tech](http://www.grandcentraltech.com/). They have a pretty interesting offer to startups, and could really help out the startup scene in New York. It's also just a nice space as well, which is an added bonus.

Afterwards, I stopped by [RC](https://www.recurse.com/), and ended up talking with @zackmaril, @nancycthomas, @happyspork, @dino_joel and @mrdrozdov. It was a nice reminder that I still haven't met someone through RC that I didn't like.

I went and saw [Deadpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(film)) on Saturday, which was hilarious. I was laughing the whole way through. Now that the movie is out, we're starting to hear [more about what it took to get Deadpool made](http://www.polygon.com/2016/2/11/10970922/it-took-an-illegal-act-to-get-deadpool-made).

I loved BBC's [The Dating Game](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-2e3f0042-75f6-4bd1-b4fe-9056540c65f8). It's an interesting look into how people are using online dating around the world.

And the Associated Press's look into [Cruz Crew app](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/2db0fc93cf664a63909e26e708e91c67/cruz-app-data-collection-helps-campaign-read-minds-voters) was interesting as well.

Two other article I enjoyed were [Logging v. instrumentation](http://peter.bourgon.org/blog/2016/02/07/logging-v-instrumentation.html) and [Text Mining South Park](http://kaylinwalker.com/text-mining-south-park/).

Finally, there were a lot of great trailers that came out last week (or that I finally saw):

 - [Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cle_rKBpZ28&feature=youtu.be)
 - [Season 4 Of 'House Of Cards'](https://digg.com/video/house-of-cards-season-4-trailer-frank-claire)
 - [Independance Day](https://youtu.be/g5K0lKrebqg)

I hope you have a great week!
