2016! Let's be honest, I much prefer even numbers to odd numbers, so a new even year is making me pretty #happy.

There were two fantastic interviews with President Obama I watched this week. One [by NPR](https://www.npr.org/2015/12/21/460030344/video-and-transcript-nprs-interview-with-president-obama) was very serious. One [by Jerry Seinfeld](http://comediansincarsgettingcoffee.com/president-barack-obama-just-tell-him-you-re-the-president) was pretty hilarious.

Also in the world of interviews, I finally listened to [Terry Gross interviewed by Marc Maron](https://www.npr.org/2015/05/20/407981536/terry-gross-to-marc-maron-life-is-harder-than-radio). Such a fantastic interview. It's interesting to hear how much Terry Gross struggles with being the interviewee.

I loved George R.R. Martin's fantasticly transparent view [into the progress on Winds of Winter this year](https://web.archive.org/web/20240320222019/https://grrm.livejournal.com/465247.html). It's a sad article to read as a fan, but his willingness to share was amazing.

In the world of security, after [32c3](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2015/wiki/Main_Page) this month, [some](https://blog.rootshell.be/2015/12/30/the-truth-is-in-your-logs/) [people](https://twitter.com/botherder/status/682130392527302656) started seeing weird log messages in their apache logs.

I really liked the blog post [Shields Down](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/shields-down/) by @rands. It really got me thinking about how attrition works at businesses.

I also finally read [Excuse Us While We Kiss The Sky](https://www.gq.com/story/urban-explorers-gq-march-2013?mbid=social_fb_fanpage&printable=true) which is just a great read about Urban Exploration, which I discovered after listening to the [The Matthew Power Literary Reporting Award](https://longform.org/posts/the-matthew-power-literary-reporting-award) episode of Longform from 2014.

In the world of gear and fashion, [Outlier Clothsography](https://www.illposed.com/outlier/), which shows every piece of clothing [Outlier](http://outlier.cc/) has ever created has been really interesting to scroll through. And for some reason, @t's [Mozlando Packing Photo](http://tantek.com/2015/345/t2/packed-days-mozlando-fits-boblbee) scratched a similar itch in my brain.

Finally, [Goodreads Top Quotes of 2015](https://www.goodreads.com/blog/show/600-10-quotes-readers-fell-in-love-with-this-year) showed me this wonderful quote:

 >  "Don't wait for a light to appear at the end of the tunnel, stride down there and light the bloody thing yourself." -- [Sara Henderson](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes_of_the_day/1746)
