Always in the know about cool music, @gnclmorais turned me onto this band called [BadBadNotGood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BadBadNotGood). He particularly mentioned these three videos of the band playing in an old warehouse called the [Moran Plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moran_Municipal_Generation_Station). The place looks awesome, and is an old power plant in Vermont. BBNG's jazzy experimental electronic style is really awesome.The style makes me think of [Math Rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Math_rock), [Jazz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz) and [Progressive Rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_rock)...
