  A review of Dave Chappelle's recent Bay Area popup show, including thoughts on
  the material and the hype around his "return."

I saw Chappelle in Oakland, and this is a very accurate description of his show. He's been doing these popup shows in the bay area for a few years now, so I'm skeptical of how imminent his return is, but it's a great show nonetheless.
