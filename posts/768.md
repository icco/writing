I like it, and so I think I'll take a stab at it later in this post. The first bullet shall be my first section though. How was 2025? in a word: shit.

It has some amazing moments, but two facts lowered the mood immensly: 

1. the political realities in the US deteriorating
2. the fact that my wife and I were living apart for most of the year
