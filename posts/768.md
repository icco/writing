[alanza on lines](https://llllllll.co/t/goals-2026/73619) has recommended framework for goals in 2026. 

> how was 2025 for you?
> what concepts / principles are you thinking about for the new year? how do they relate to the world around you? (locally? globally?)
> what old things do you want to shed? what new things would you like to cultivate?
> what would you like to accomplish?
> do you have a plan for making it happen?
> does your year ahead have a ‘theme’ that you’d like to give it?
> how about the next three months? the next month? the next week?
