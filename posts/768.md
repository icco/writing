It's that time of year, it's time for #yearinreview!

I've been thinking about what I want to say this year, and then I came across [alanza on lines](https://llllllll.co/t/goals-2026/73619) suggesting a framework for thinking about goals at the end of 2025.

> how was 2025 for you?
>
> what concepts / principles are you thinking about for the new year? how do they relate to the world around you? (locally? globally?)
>
> what old things do you want to shed? what new things would you like to cultivate?
>
> what would you like to accomplish?
>
> do you have a plan for making it happen?
>
> does your year ahead have a ‘theme’ that you’d like to give it?
>
> how about the next three months? the next month? the next week?

I like it, and so I think I'll take a stab at it later in this post. The first bullet shall be my first section though. How was 2025? in a word: meh[^4].

[^4]: Initial draft of this section had "shit". I have since upgraded it to meh. You're welcome?

It has some amazing moments, but two facts lowered the mood immensely:

1. The political realities in the US, which is causing deteriorating living situations for friends and others.
2. The fact that my wife and I were living apart for most of the year.

Having worked on two political campaigns that lost to Trump[^5], I feel pretty weird about watching the rights of fellow citizens destroyed and erased. A strong feeling of depression and lack of wanting to engage, and just a general feeling of hopelessness. There were weeks where I was able to completely ignore the news, and weeks where I was deep in it. While many of my friends have been enraged by everything going on, I have found it hard to feel anything besides depression when thinking about the future of my home country.

[^5]: I volunteered for a few weeks for Kamala, and worked  for Clinton. So it's like 1.1, but whatever. 

On top of our societal issues, I did not handle Mel being so far away for so long well. I've always had theories that I wouldn't handle long distance relationships well, and boi did I validate that theory in 2025.

It wasn't all bad though. I got more involved in my local community, played lots of board games with friends, and had a very successful year at work. 

I really like doing these years in review, going through each month's photos highlighted a lot of great times though the year.

## January

January, like always, was pretty quiet and chill. It snowed. I hung out with Mel before she went back to school.

## February

February was great. Two trips back to back. First I went to San Antonio, TX for work where we did our winter offsite. Historically our winter off-sites are not great. We discuss how we didn't do as well as we needed to last year, etc etc. This year though, we had knocked it out of the park in 2024, and it was just a big celebration.

Afterwards I went to London for my birthday and hung out with Mel. It was great. Lots of art, food and good times.

## March

March, not a lot happened. Continued playing lots of Dungeons and Dragons and music. General hanging out and recovering from a busy February.

## April

April, the flowers were out and Spring arrived. Niket visited briefly, and my mom came by for a long visit where we went into the city, and visited some friends in Providence, RI.

## May

May had two people visit: Chris came for a long weekend where we wandered the Hudson Valley and had a grand ol' time. And then Mel visited! She had a brief summer break and hung out for a week. It was wonderful.

## June

June I got to finally meet one of my favorite authors, [Craig Mod](https://craigmod.com/). Some friends and I went to a baseball game. I also continued going into the city for work every Tuesday (sometimes going out to dinner with coworkers).

## July

## 2025 Goal Review

# Looking forward to 2026

Ok, so 2026 has already started. It's a new year, so time to think about the future.

> what concepts / principles are you thinking about for the new year? how do they relate to the world around you? (locally? globally?)



> what old things do you want to shed? what new things would you like to cultivate?

I want to hoard less stuff. Get rid of things that are unneeded. I have started this already: donating and getting rid of old clothes that don't fit, throwing away unused boxes, donating things that I haven't used in years.

I want to cultivate spending more time in nature. I spend too much time inside. I need to be in Nature and outside every day if I can.

> does your year ahead have a ‘theme’ that you’d like to give it?

Moving forward.
 
> how about the next three months? the next month? the next week?

## Goals

> What would you like to accomplish? Do you have a plan for making it happen?

I have three goals / objectives for 2026. I want these to be connected to my [general manifesto](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/703)[^3].

[^3]: I think I want to update this in 2026. Not sure yet, but thinking about it.

1. Be in Nature
2. Create Art
3. Improve Health

### 1: Be in Nature

To accomplish this I've got two things I will be measuring and doing:

- Walk for more than 30 minutes every day
- Try a new trail or go fishing once a month

2025 was a bad year for me getting outside, so I feel like I need to rekindle my connection to nature. I need to walk more for my health, but also my days are drastically better when I spend time among the trees and birds, so I want to set this as a goal.

When it comes to nature, I find myself revisiting the same trails and places. I want to explore more of the Hudson Valley,  and fishing basically always sends me to new places. New trails would do the same, so that's where that comes from.

### 2: Create Art

Creating art brings me joy. I am not good at it. This is something I have been fighting with for... most of my life. It's an issue with confidence, and just not being able to accept that sucking is ok. That being said, I am a lot more confident in my creativity than I was in 2024. I made a lot of progress around sharing my art in 2025, and got a lot of good feedback. In 2026, I want to create more and share more.

- Write every day
- Make one song a week
- Finish locative.garden
- Put out an album on Bandcamp

### 3: Improve Health

There's some diet and vitamin deficiencies I need to deal with in 2026. I haven't figured out what that's going to be yet. But along with getting out in nature[^1], I am going to try and do something new.

[^1]: Lots of doctors say and studies show that being in Nature is good for your health. [USDA](https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/blog/mentally-and-physically-trees-make-difference), [Harvard School of Public Health](https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/the-health-benefits-of-trees/) and [NYDEC](https://dec.ny.gov/nature/forests-trees/immerse-yourself-for-better-health) as examples.

[![kh3dron's pushup spreadsheet](https://icco.imgix.net/photos/2026/0P50DKA49PR3E.jpg?w=500)](https://icco.imgix.net/photos/2026/0P50DKA49PR3E.jpg)

This something new is inspired by my friend and coworker @kh3dron. He's trying to do 100,000 pushups in 2026. A photo of his progress is above. He's a swole dude[^2], so I'm not really trying to set my goal at a level that I know I'll fail. Instead I am trying for a much smaller goal of push-ups and sit-ups.

[^2]: Bro has six blackbelts and is made of pure muscle and brain matter as far as I can tell.

- 20,000 push-ups in 2026
- 20,000 sit-ups in 2026

I've created a spreadsheet like his, so we'll see how it goes. His one piece of advice which kind of blew my mind is that you don't have to do all of the push-ups at once. You can do them throughout the day. And I'm like, I can do five pushups ten times in a day. That is totally doable. Reframe the issues! Focus on total output!

# Conclusion
