Hey all!

I’ll be in the Pacific NorthWest on the following dates:

 - January 4-8: Portland
 - January 8-16: Seattle
 - January 16-20: Victoria, BC
 - January 20-23: Vancouver, BC

I would love to talk to folks on just about any topic, and anyone from strangers to people I’ve known for years, so please hit me up.

Things I could chat about:

 - SRE & devops
 - distributed computing
 - programming
 - politics
 - tea
 - coffee
 - beer
 - recurse center
 - any combination of the above

I would also gladly give a 20 minute talk to your company and/or community about tech and presidential campaigns, if that’s something that interests you. Or I could do an extension of my [SRE Office Hours](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/615) in person, if that's something you would like.

I’m free for a lot of my time (especially weekdays during the day) and would love to talk for a while, no matter how obscure our connection (following me on twitter, you attended RC, random blog stalker, whatever!)

nat@natwelch.com or @icco.

Cheers,  
/Nat
