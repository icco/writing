I couldn't find a good copy of this, but at the end of [Chef](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chef_%282014_film%29), there is this great video of [Jon Favreau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Favreau) learning to cook a grilled cheese. Felt like a perfect description of any creative endeavor. The audio is the key. I'll see if I can make a copy or something...
