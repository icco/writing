With Super Tuesday this week, I didn't get a ton of #tenbysix work done. I had one night with a lot of coding though, so that was good.

## Stuff I worked on this week:

I saw the following tweet late one evening.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Who wants to join my webring?</p>&mdash; ¸.•´¯`• GOLD •`¯´•.¸ (@jongold) <a href="https://twitter.com/jongold/status/704517861063180288">March 1, 2016</a></blockquote>

Everyone loves @jongold. I have never met him in person, but I hear nothing but good things. We chatted on [the Simple Casual slack](http://simplecasual.com/) for a little bit, and I decided to build some basic webring software. This is essentially the basis for one direction I could take [RingClub](https://github.com/icco/ringclub), but instead goes more towards a traditional web ring instead of an advertising network, which is what I'm thinking of for RingClub. So yeah, the code is at [icco/ringdirector](https://github.com/icco/ringdirector), and that has a basic description of how it works and how to join!
