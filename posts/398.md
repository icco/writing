[Oddisee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oddisee) did a great [Tiny Desk Concert on NPR](http://www.npr.org/event/music/417459405/oddisee-tiny-desk-concert?autoplay=true).

@pliable introduced me to Oddisee last year, and I've been hooked ever since. He has [a solid soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/oddiseemusic), and sells all of [his music on bandcamp](https://oddisee.bandcamp.com/).

My favorite albums from him right now are [The Beauty In All](https://oddiseemmg.bandcamp.com/album/the-beauty-in-all) and [People Hear What They See](https://oddiseemmg.bandcamp.com/album/people-hear-what-they-see). But with the launch of [The Good Fight](https://oddiseemmg.bandcamp.com/album/the-good-fight) we shall see if that changes.
