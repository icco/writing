Ok team, I know I've been failing to publish regularly, and for that I am sorry.

My internal anxiety is that I've got so much I want to share, and curating that seems insurmountable. So instead, I'm taking a hint from the infamous @niket, and just suggesting one thing per category. So here's the first #happy post in a very, very long time.

**One great listen**: [Reply All's The Founder](https://www.gimletmedia.com/reply-all/the-founder) is fascinating. It features one of my favorite journalists, @ev\_rat, and is an amazing story about programming, organized crime, infrastructure and people.

**One great watch**: Russian Doll on Netflix. It's absolutely amazing. @mel\_cantrell and I binge watched it, and while dark, it was hilarious, beautiful and creepy. The NYT [collected a bunch of great write ups about the show](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/arts/russian-doll-what-to-read-about-the-hit-netflix-series.html).

**One great read**: I really enjoyed [What would a EvE online Internet look like?](https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/post/eve-online-bgp-internet) by @benjojo12. It's a fascinating dive into internet infrastructure and thinking about how technology scales to cover large spans of space.

And a photo\! Because I've added photo upload support to my blog for the first time inâ€¦ years.

Have a great one\!
