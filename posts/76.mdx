[Josette Melchor](http://techcrunch.com/2014/05/30/gray-area/) founder of [Gray Area](http://grayarea.org/).

 > "She’s been the one-woman force behind the creation of San Francisco’s Gray Area (also known as GAFFTA), a non-profit that has validated an emerging form of art called creative coding over the past decade. Creative coding is about programming expressive, rather than functional, work. It runs the gamut from data visualization, like this very early Gray Area-supported project from [Stamen Design that made interactive maps of Tenderloin data on crime and cabs](http://stamen.com/projects/gaffta), to projection mapping, like this [pretty astonishing video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX6JcybgDFo&feature=kp) from Bot & Dolly in Potrero Hill. Gray Area has also pioneered [urban prototyping](https://www.facebook.com/UrbanPrototyping), a movement to get city residents involved in trialing new ideas for city life through quick, inexpensive and temporary projects. The '[parklet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parklet),' first popularized in San Francisco, is a prime example."
