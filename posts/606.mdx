It's a beautiful Sunday here in Brooklyn, so it's time for another #happy post!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="und" dir="ltr">! <a href="https://t.co/0MDFpNchAz">pic.twitter.com/0MDFpNchAz</a></p>&mdash; Robert Khoo (@rkhoo) <a href="https://twitter.com/rkhoo/status/772280805972385792">September 4, 2016</a></blockquote>

This tweet probably requires a bit of explanation as to why it makes me so happy. [Robert Khoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Khoo) is one of those people who inspires me. He recently decided to step down as the head of business at [Penny Arcade](https://www.penny-arcade.com/), and this is a picture making fun of him for that, at the convention [PAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAX_(event)) which he helped found and create. His work at PA has greatly affected my life, but in ways I'm not sure I can describe. PA made me friends with @markgius and @madrox. It gave me some great road trips. It brought me closer to my cousin Becky. It showed me that you can truly make a company out of anything on the internet. All of this wouldn't have happened if @rkhoo hadn't run the business side of PA.

Speaking of people, Gene Wilder died this week. I really enjoyed [Gene Wilder: Master Of The Comedic Pause](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFq9AbVZSbo&feature=youtu.be) showing his acting talents.

Also in people, [Kanye deconstructed: the human voice as the ultimate instrument](http://www.vox.com/2016/9/1/12735222/kanye-west-human-voice-instrument) is a great look into Kanye's musical style.

On the Media did a nice episode bringing together some of my favorite segments on print media called [Print Is Back, Back Again](http://pca.st/z9ZT).

[David Lynch on Where Great Ideas Come From](http://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/491738/david-lynch-on-where-great-ideas-come-from/) is an inspiring video from The Atlantic.

And then there are two great full show videos from two of my favorite artists at festivals this summer:

 - [FKA twigs Performs at Pitchfork Music Festival 2016 | Full Set - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QW3uyDG0IM&feature=youtu.be)
 - [Radiohead - Live Outside Lands Festival 2016 (Full Show) HD - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsYxwPCGxy8&feature=youtu.be)


Finally, two of my coworkers had things written about them this week:

 - @twephanie - [5 Things We Learned From Hillary Clinton's Campaign CTO](http://fortune.com/2016/08/29/hillary-clinton-cto-stephanie-hannon/)
 - @mina - [The Key to Clinton’s Identity Online? It’s Pantsuit](https://www.wired.com/2016/09/key-clintons-identity-online-pantsuit/)

Have a great week everyone!
