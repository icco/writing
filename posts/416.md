Ok, what made me #happy last week:

Drake's [Hotline Bling](https://web.archive.org/web/20240126154228/https://genius.com/Drake-hotline-bling-lyrics) has been sweeping the internet. @alexbaldwin's [Hotline Bling MEGAMix](https://ruby.fm/alexbaldwin/hotline-bling-megamix) takes this mediocre song and stretches it into an addictive forty minutes. Now I can't stop humming "You used to call me on your cell phone..."

Once you're ready to get the song out of your head, check out @alexbaldwin's other genius creation this week, [Console.FM #15](https://ruby.fm/consolefm/artisan-015). It had me tapping my feet through the entire mix.

@niket recommended [Antifragile](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13530973-antifragile). So far it's been a great read (I'm about 20 percent in). The author seems like a bit of a jerk, but has some very interesting ideas. The Goodreads reviews seem to be pretty polarizing, so it'll be interesting to see what I think at the end.
