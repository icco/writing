These three articles are all kind of loosely connected. First, Github and Holman talking about building features. It's nothing new, but it's such an awesome sounding world to develop in. I feel like Google does thing similarly, but at such a different scale and scope. Second, a comic adaptation of [Neil Gaiman's famous commencement speech](https://vimeo.com/42372767). Third, an article about clearing your head with paper. Three things about creating stuff. Now go make something.
