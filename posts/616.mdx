I upgraded to a new version of tachyons on my blog today. This is a continuation of the work I wrote about in "[Upgrading CSS on natwelch.com](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/608)". I'm not sure if I'm happy with the changes. I need to sit down and do some sketching to see if there is a design I like better by starting from the ground up.
