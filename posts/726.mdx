- "[I Made the Most Banned Book in America](https://thenib.com/i-made-the-most-banned-book-in-america/)" is a fascinating comic, and also a reminder that the end has arrived for The Nib, one of the greatest political comic websites. [Their final newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/thenib/the-end-bwh4vjd6g0) made me tear up a little, as I worked on The Nib while I was at First Look Media for two years. It wasn't my sole job, but I was happy to support such a wonderful website.
- "[What’s Inside That McDonald’s Ice Cream Machine?](https://www.ifixit.com/News/80215/whats-inside-that-mcdonalds-ice-cream-machine-broken-copyright-law)" is another former employer of mine, fighting the good fight: iFixit.
- Another former employer, Google published [The big picture: How Google Photos scaled rapidly on Spanner](https://goo.gle/44HbYDL) which I found very interesting. Spanner is probably the most interesting development in Database technology in the last decade, so always exciting to see more written about it.
- Finally in former employers, a friend and former coworker published [Mental models of on-call](https://www.mattb.nz/w/2023/09/01/mental-models-of-on-call/) which really resonated with me.
- Then completely unrelated to work, two great posts on coffee. Scan of the Month published [CT scans of common coffee machines](https://www.scanofthemonth.com/scans/coffee) and there's a blog post of [the fascinating history of coffee in a can](https://one-from-nippon.ghost.io/coffee-in-a-can/)
- And in the planet is dying news, I learned about the [Indicators of Global Climate Change for Policy Makers Dashboard](https://climatechangetracker.org/igcc) which is depressing, and read an opinion piece of folks trying to get less cars in cities: "[We’re Taking New York City’s Streets Back — and Then We’re Coming for the Rest of the Country](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/02/opinion/were-taking-new-york-citys-streets-back-and-then-were-coming-for-the-rest-of-the-country.html?smid=nytcore-android-share)."
- Finally, I found this cool tool called [rclip](https://github.com/yurijmikhalevich/rclip). It's for searching a folder of images based on keywords. It'll use some AI to analyze the images and then list the images that match. I have a bunch of folders with images, and I've wanted a tool like this for a long time! The installation and search are not fast, but it works great.
