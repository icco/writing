This was a fantastic video, hilarious as two men try and create and eat all of the food in the most recent Legend of Zelda game. They try very hard to only use the ingredients that Link uses, and unsurprisingly, that causes lots of issues.

I actually think about this all the time when playing games and there is a cooking mechanic. The idea of combining two things and getting something good is actually quite hard. I try it all the time at home with mixed success. For some reason, cooking is the one thing I cannot suspend my beliefs on and just escape. I find myself avoiding cooking minigames, because they seem so absurd to me...

Oh well, funny \(and long\) video, please enjoy.
