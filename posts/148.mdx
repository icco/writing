So, Wednesday, I spent a lot of time researching productivity tools. I generally believe coding is like writing, so when I saw ProductHunt had a [Tools for Writers](https://www.producthunt.com/e/tools-for-writers), I got lost for hours. Some of the cool things I saw included:

 - http://writerkata.com/
 - http://www.dailypage.co/
 - http://blankpage.io/
 - http://paragraphsapp.com/
 - http://tadamapp.com/
 - https://typewrite.io/
 - http://writeapp.net/

What I finally tried out though, was [Pomodero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). I'm using [Tadam](http://tadamapp.com/) for now. I found my productivity increase, but holy crap it's hard to not answer IMs. 

I also really liked the @textfiles [article on backing up the Internet Archive](http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/4636). Lots to think about there.

In the evening, we went out to Pho, and then watched [What we do in the shadows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_We_Do_in_the_Shadows) which was hilarious.
