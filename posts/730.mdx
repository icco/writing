Well this is a really delayed post. on September 20th to 23rd I was in St. Louis, MO for the final edition of the [Strange Loop](https://www.thestrangeloop.com/) conference. This was my fourth time attending, and the first real social conference I had attended since the beginning of the pandemic. It was a bit more anxiety inducing then I would have wished, but I still had a lot of fun. I saw a lot of friends from the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), plus just a lot of random NYC tech friends.

This Strange Loop as always had some of the best talks of any tech conference. Below are my favorites.


## Making hard things easy

This talk was on the last day and went in depth about how to teach yourself things you don't know. It was a great talk for thinking about how you learn things.
