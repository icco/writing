A #happy post on time? What a crazy concept. Wednesday through today were pretty crazy at work (had a short notice trip down to DC), so I don't have a ton of links, but enough to keep you crazy kids entertained.

Let's start off with the grand ol' RBG. [Ruth Bader Ginsburgâ€™s Advice for Living](http://nyti.ms/2dtHcrW) was put out by the New York Times as a preview of her upcoming book, and it's fantastic.

Many of you know I have a weird obsession with fashion, and The New York Times's [In the Studio With Christian Louboutin](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/02/fashion/in-the-studio-with-christian-louboutin-paris-fashion-week.html) is really cool. I love how his offices are all spread out. It sounds like such a nice way to spread people out compared to the huge open office format I am used to.

Finally, in my third "Nat reads too much NYT" piece, I really liked the desktop experience of "[Penn Station Reborn](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/09/30/opinion/penn-station-reborn.html?smid=tw-share&_r=0)". Such cool design really showed the history of the station and where it might go.

[Longform's interview with A.J. Daulerio](https://longform.org/posts/longform-podcast-213-a-j-daulerio) is absolutely fascinating. I would recommend reading up on the Gawker lawsuit before listening because they don't go too deep into the context of his lawsuits, but rather focus on how the lawsuits are effecting his life and journalism.

I didn't know Postgres had full-text search, but @rachbelaid's "[Postgres full-text search is Good Enough!](http://rachbelaid.com/postgres-full-text-search-is-good-enough/)" was neat and taught me a lot about this feature I didn't know existed.

[Google Public DNS](https://dns.google.com/)'s HTTP user interface launched recently, and it's amazing.

Short and sweet this week! I hope you have a great one. Fall is here; the rains are coming and it's time to breath a sigh of relief and look forward to the winter. Sweaters, hoodies, hot chocolate and fire places: oh my!
