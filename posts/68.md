[Angry Nerd: The 10 Most Underrated Movies of 2014](http://www.wired.com/2014/12/angry-nerd-underrated-movies-2014/) is actually a fantastic list of movies from 2014. The annoying part is none of it's in text. I hate video only content. Great the first watch, but then I can't reference it later. So stupid.

Anyways, here's the list.

 1. Edge of Tomorrow aka Live. Die. Repeat.
 2. The Tale of The Princess Kaguya
 3. They Came Together
 4. Snowpiercer
 5. Jodorowsky's Dune
 6. Journey to the West
 7. The Raid 2 (Shout out, [Gareth Evans List His Top 5 Action Scenes](http://www.slashfilm.com/watch-raid-director-gareth-evans-list-top-5-action-scenes/))
 8. The One I Love
 9. The Congress
 10. Only Lovers Left Alive

Others mentioned: Cooties, Open Windows, The Rover, Enemy, The Double, The Zero Theorem, Blue Ruin, Automata, Coherence, Stretch, The Babadook, Under The Skin, The Vanquishing of the Witch Baba Yaga, A Most Wanted Man, To Be Takei, The Galapagos Affair and Alan Partridge.
