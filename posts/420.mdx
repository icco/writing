Despite being slightly sick all week, some things made me very #happy this past week.

Let's start with the biggest thing, [Jessica Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones_(TV_series)) on Netflix is amazing. Fantastic television. 

In terms of art, I've been enjoying [Mynt Condition](http://myntcondition.tumblr.com/) and [Shia LaBeouf's AllMyMovies](http://www.theverge.com/2015/11/16/9731856/shia-labeouf-all-my-movies-live-stream). The [mechanical techno](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl1ZrEza7uY&feature=youtu.be) video is also blowing my mind.

In terms of comedy, this NYT article titled [Marriott Merger Has Starwood Lovers Nervous](http://nyti.ms/1Yg3mvT) is one of the greatest pieces of satire and first world problems I've read in a while. [Stephen Colbert's interview with Bill Maher](https://newrepublic.com/minutes/123989/stephen-colbert-and-bill-maher-dont-seem-to-like-each-other-very-much) was both hilarious and interesting

Anyways, that's what made me happy this week in the world of entertainment.
