So, [a while back](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/100), I mentioned I was super excited for [the new Deus Ex game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_Ex:_Mankind_Divided). One thing I screen-capped from the [E3 Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdVexfTfevU) at 1:39 and then have been staring at ever since, is this environmental scene of someone's apartment.

I particularly love the lighting fixture at the top. So much so that I've been sketching out ways to build it. I was thinking of adding an Arduino to then use some sort of data (probably weather) to affect the colors.

This morning, I saw a tweet from [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) talking about some chandeleir that was at their conference. It had a picture attached.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Learn how one team built a 25 foot, interactive chandelier for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/signalconf?src=hash">#signalconf</a> <a href="http://t.co/OV16rSDqoW">http://t.co/OV16rSDqoW</a> <a href="http://t.co/HmditqAh2U">pic.twitter.com/HmditqAh2U</a></p>&mdash; twilio (@twilio) <a href="https://twitter.com/twilio/status/619530523321327616">July 10, 2015</a></blockquote>

My brain instantaneously went "it's a huge version of the thing I want to build!"

The link led me to [an article by the firm that built the thing](http://work.gmunk.com/Twilio-Beacon) with lots of photos and also [an interview and brief description on the twilio blog](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2015/07/building-beacon-how-one-team-built-a-25-foot-interactive-chandelier-at-signal.html). Pretty cool stuff!

Now I've got to build mine, although it'll be much smaller and simpler...

**Update:** I watched through [the gameplay trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh-iX2bxOjI) of #deusex, and snapped some more cool lighting.
