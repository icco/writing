I spent most of the day working with [Pam](https://twitter.com/pamasaur) on flushing out her idea for [ShhParty](https://github.com/pselle/shhparty/tree/socketio). We did a bunch of whiteboarding and chatting about how to build something that doesn't know about its clients.

After whiteboarding and chatting, we paired for a while trying to figure out [Peer.js](http://peerjs.com/), [Socket.io](http://socket.io/) and [RTCMultiConnection](https://github.com/muaz-khan/WebRTC-Experiment/tree/master/RTCMultiConnection).

I also wrote up two proposals for the next issue of [Code Words](https://codewords.recurse.com/). They are both articles I really want to write, so I'll probably write them even if they don't get accepted.

I leave you with a picture of a new meme I'm starting. Serious Cat.
