It's time for another #happy post! I'm currently on my way to the Bahamas for a week of relaxation on the beach, which is what's truly making me happy.

Watch

 - [NYT Cooking On The Job](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYG6O_GQCZwjHuu5swGZ6c8sZq6SpC87q) has a fantastic video about [a dishwasher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyHPuYpetbg). I really enjoyed this dive into a day in the life of a very important but rarely thought about role.
 - I rewatched two of my favorite Anime over the weekend: [The Wind Rises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wind_Rises) and [Keep your hands off Eizouken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep_Your_Hands_Off_Eizouken!).

Listen

 - Hank Green guest-hosted one of my favorite podcasts, and it's a delight: [Guest host Hank Green makes Nilay Patel explain why websites have a future](https://www.theverge.com/24087834/hank-green-decoder-podcast-google-youtube-web-media-platforms-distribution-future).

Read

 - [Hugo Bara on the Vision Pro](https://hugo.blog/2024/03/11/vision-pro/) had a lot of interesting insights from someone who has worked on VR for many years.

Play

 - Thanks to [this article on Arstechnica](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/03/sixty-four-is-an-idle-clicker-a-factory-sim-and-a-dark-extractive-journey/), I briefly got addicted to [Sixty-Four](https://sunandstuff.com/sixtyfour/).
 - I started up [Phantom Liberty](https://www.cyberpunk.net/us/en/phantom-liberty) and it's amazing.
 - Still haven't finished BG3. Waiting till I have a full day I can power through the end of game content.


I hope you have a great week!
