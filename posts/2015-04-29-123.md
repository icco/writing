I loved [Matt Fraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Fraction)'s run of [Hawkeye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawkeye_%28comics%29). Entertainment Weekly \(I know, surprised me too\) even did a nice article describing why it was so great: "[Farewell, Bro: How Matt Fraction's 'Hawkeye' changed Marvel Comics](http://www.ew.com/article/2015/03/02/farewell-bro-how-matt-fractions-hawkeye-changed-marvel-comics)".

But if you want to get a quick summary of what the comic was like, you can watch [Renner on Fallon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQ27iS1mkuo), or read this panel:
