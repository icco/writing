Week 2 of 2024's #happy posts. Two times makes a successfully cemented habit, right?

TV & Movies

- In anime watching, I watched this weeks episodes of [Delicious in Dungeon](), [Solo Leveling](), [The Apothecary Diaries]() and [Frieren](). In anime watching, I've been thinking about picking up [Undead Unluck]() and [High Card S2]() but haven't yet.
- We rewatched [Moulin Rouge](). I probably last saw it twenty years ago. 
- This weeks [Bob's Burgers]() was fantastic.
- The finale of [For All Mankind]() was a bit trippy. I didn't quite expect Margo's or Miles's outcomes.

Music

- I've been listening to some favorite older albums on repeat: [Give Up by The Postal Service](https://open.spotify.com/album/5MoaDbFw4nrm2P7Om1on3b?si=qN9HAFPWQymN0KLTXesBlg) and [So Jealous by Tegan and Sara](https://open.spotify.com/album/2yNhqBKfZPzrxRJqGMbSz9?si=ikLTfFVGTzuEal-LWj4nJw).

Play

- Played the boardgame [Votes for Women](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/311900/votes-women) and it was a delight. Lots of fun, and learned a ton of history. A bit complicated to setup, but once it's going makes total sense. We played with three people, but could see it being a lot of fun with two or four as well.
