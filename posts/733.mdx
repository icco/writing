Week 2 of 2024's #happy posts. Two times makes a successfully cemented habit, right?

Anime

- I watched this weeks episodes of [Delicious in Dungeon](), [Solo Leveling](), [The Apothecary Diaries]() and [Frieren](). 
- I've been thinking about picking up [Undead Unluck]() and [High Card S2]() but haven't yet.

TV & Movies

- We rewatched [Moulin Rouge](). I probably last saw it twenty years ago. 
- This weeks [Bob's Burgers]() was fantastic.
- The finale of [For All Mankind]() was a bit trippy. I didn't quite expect Margo's or Miles's outcomes.

Music
