Week 2 of 2024's #happy posts. Two times makes a successfully cemented habit, right?

TV & Movies

- In anime watching, I watched this weeks episodes of [Delicious in Dungeon](https://anilist.co/anime/153518/Delicious-in-Dungeon/), [Solo Leveling](https://anilist.co/anime/151807/Solo-Leveling/), [The Apothecary Diaries](https://anilist.co/anime/161645/The-Apothecary-Diaries/) and [Frieren](https://anilist.co/anime/154587/Frieren-Beyond-Journeys-End/). In anime watching, I've been thinking about picking up [Undead Unluck](https://anilist.co/anime/154116/Undead-Unluck/) and [High Card S2](https://anilist.co/anime/163151/HIGH-CARD-Season-2/) but haven't yet.
- We rewatched [Moulin Rouge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moulin_Rouge!). I probably last saw it twenty years ago. I had forgetten how weird this movie is.
- This weeks [Bob's Burgers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob%27s_Burgers) was fantastic.
- The finale of [For All Mankind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_All_Mankind_(TV_series)) was a bit trippy. I didn't quite expect Margo's or Miles's outcomes.

Music

- I've been listening to some favorite older albums on repeat: [Give Up by The Postal Service](https://open.spotify.com/album/5MoaDbFw4nrm2P7Om1on3b?si=qN9HAFPWQymN0KLTXesBlg) and [So Jealous by Tegan and Sara](https://open.spotify.com/album/2yNhqBKfZPzrxRJqGMbSz9?si=ikLTfFVGTzuEal-LWj4nJw).

Play

- Played the boardgame [Votes for Women](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/311900/votes-women) and it was a delight. Lots of fun, and learned a ton of history. A bit complicated to setup, but once it's going makes total sense. We played with three people, but could see it being a lot of fun with two or four as well.
