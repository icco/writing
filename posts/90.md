Day 5 was slow, wandered around Greenpoint, read a lot. Hacker School / Recurse Center starts tomorrow.

I sketched up some ideas for [NatRoku](https://github.com/icco/natroku). I'm constantly reminded that PAAS don't fit my use case. I think Flynn might be configurable to do what I want, but I'm not sure yet. I don't really want to build this, but it's one of those things that I constantly think about.

Interesting things I read yesterday:
