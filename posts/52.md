As heard at the end of "[Design Matters With Debbie Millman: Liz Danzico](http://designobserver.com/feature/liz-danzico/38700/)", which as far as I can tell is a merger of http://bobulate.com/post/14047770566/lessons-according-to-salt and http://bobulate.com/post/100527482559/this-is-new-york:

What do you find yourself thinking about during the meeting when you're supposed to be thinking about something else? What just feels right? Because that is the drive to do something you care just enough about to make change.
