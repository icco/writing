[Douglas Tompkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Tompkins), the founder of The North Face,  [died on December 8th, 2015](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/09/business/douglas-tompkins-72-north-face-founder-dies-in-kayaking-accident.html).

I use products by [The North Face](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_North_Face) every day. And while Mr. Tompkins hasn't been running the company since I have been alive, it's cool to see his impact. His Wikipedia article describes him as a "conservationist, outdoorsman, philanthropist, filmmaker, agriculturalist, and businessman." It's pretty inspiring to see someone whose description starts at conservationist and ends at businessman, because this makes me think of the positive influence he has had on the world.

So thank you for your work Douglas Tompkins. May your legacy live on.
