Started the day nice and slow. Clicked around on the internet, did my laundry, played some more Broken Age, read some more of The Innovators, etc.

When I got into RC, I continued my exploration about building a drum machine in HTML. I liked the idea behind  [html5drummachine.com](http://html5drummachine.com/), but prefered the look of [Stepkit](http://jxnblk.com/stepkit/). I was thinking of making something like Stepkit, but was optimised for mobile, and allowed for the recording of new drumkits through your mic (on the fly sampling yo!). Sadly I also discovered that Chrome Webview on Android [doesn't support the Audio API](http://caniuse.com/#feat=audio-api), and I have a feeling (but found no listing of it) the iOS webview doesn't either. Anyways, still probably going to be my next project.

Pam mentioned she was tracking [the talkpay thing happening on twitter](http://www.theverge.com/2015/5/1/8530189/talk-pay-international-workers-day-salaries), and I decided to see if I could whip up a scraper. So I did. Yay! Right now it's pretty basic, but it's at https://hashtagsearch.herokuapp.com/, and the source is at https://github.com/icco/hashtags.

Happy Friday!
