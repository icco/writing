I [posted this on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/donate/10209802983565648/10209802983645650/), but I figured I'd repost here as well.

> Thanks everyone for the birthday wishes!

> I had a great day wandering central park and the Met with Melissa.

> In 2016, I saw what amazing work donations from individuals can create. In 2017, Iâ€™d like to try and promote that more, by donating money where I can, and to tell others about organizations I support.

> One such organization has constantly been my source for great journalism: ProPublica. They seem to always write about really important content, have won three Pulitzer Prizes for their work (2010, 2011 and 2016), and now they are also taking over a lot of the great work by the Sunlight Foundation (for example https://projects.propublica.org/politwoops/). 

> According to https://propublica.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/about/propublica-2016-annual-report.pdf, ProPublica gets around one million unique visitors per month, spends about $74k on capital costs (that probably is rent plus their AWS bill), and spends $1.6 million on non-journalist salaries.

> If you get a chance, please read their work and donate money. The world needs more in-depth journalism.

You can donate on the facebook link at the beginning of this article or just go to https://www.propublica.org/donate

Thanks,

/Nat
