Google OKRs are pretty awesome. Not everyone in the company uses them, but they really are a great way to measure what you're doing. The thing this article misses though, is how to write good ones. You need to make sure your Key Results are measurable. If you don't have a way to decide if a KR has been completed at any time during the quarter, it's not a good KR.

Also included are two articles about startups. TL;DR: Startups are hard, and lots of people in SF are doing startups.
