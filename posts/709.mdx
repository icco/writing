Lately, I've felt like a lot of the content I consume has not been inspiring me. I was recently arguing about innovation in video games with @markgius and @madrox, which caused me to watch some Let's Play videos, and I found myself inspired. Then, today, I was reading a book, and felt myself inspired again. So I figured I'd share these two pieces of work with you.

First off is [The First 37 Minutes of Death Stranding Gameplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KevFGaS298s). I found the video here like a small movie. I don't know if I'll play the game, but I found watching this first 37 minutes to be beautiful, inspiring, and kept me thinking for a while.

The reviews for this game are pretty rough, and I haven't been motivated enough to buy it, but it has me thinking, which is fun. Hilariously, the game has me thinking about one of my favorite games on the SNES, Paperboy 2. If you watch [a playthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmgYktKxNfU) you can see how absurd the game was. But the idea of focusing on delivery is an interesting view of society.

These days we can pay someone to delivery things through one of the many gig economy services. But the idea of delivery being important to society, and being difficult, has been around for a long time.

Unrelated to all this, I've been reading [The Starless Sea by Erin Morgenstern](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43565560-the-starless-sea). This book has amazing writing, and has me thinking about interesting stories and magical places. Just the descriptions in the first chapter are enough for me to want to start writing fiction again and thinking about secret societies and the magic of escapism. 

Anyways, that's some content that is inspiring me lately. Hope you're having a good one.
