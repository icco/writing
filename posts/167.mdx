Ok, so I'm going to try and make this a smooth transition to not writing about my day every day (since RC is almost over) to writing about random stuff. My original goal of this blog (and its predecessor tumble.io) was to write about what I had read and thought about each day.

So after a conversation on Thursday night with @saturnial, @mames and @josephcohen, Joe sent me an article by @fredwilson titled [The Blank Screen](http://avc.com/2015/06/the-blank-screen/) where he described the brain dump he does every day, despite the fact that he can't talk about a lot of what he does for a living.

So I'm gonna try that too. No word limit or topic besides "what's on my mind". Lets see if I can keep this streak up.
