Last week I was pretty #happy.

 - @alexbaldwin told me about [Hello from the Magic Tavern](http://hellofromthemagictavern.com/), and it is amazing. Such a hilarious podcast.
 - Two interesting stories about New York Public Transit: [Repeat Train Thief Steals Bus at Port Authority](http://nyti.ms/1OFzAiG) and [Why New York Subway Lines Are Missing Countdown Clocks](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/11/why-dont-we-know-where-all-the-trains-are/415152/)
 - Robots! [US startup challenges Japan to giant robot battle](http://bigstory.ap.org/2c5e0672427a442a8d55360f0cad2006)

Also, as I posted earlier, I've fallen in love with [BBNG](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/418).
