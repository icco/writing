Today (Well technically yesterday, as I'm posting this a day late) I Learned that RC is much quieter on Fridays. Spent the morning working through implementing an [Archive](/archives) page for this blog. It's been awhile since I've written much Go, so I feel like I forgot everything.

One thing I totally forgot about was Go's hatred of people iterating over maps. So I need to change my design to allow for sorting to get things in the right order.

Hung out with my good friends the Shaws in the afternoon. Visited the Met and saw this neat but small exhibit on baseball cards. Bought Aaron a bottle of beer for his birthday, and had a delicious italian dinner.
