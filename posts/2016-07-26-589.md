I really enjoyed these two podcasts:

 - [Jack Hitt on Longform](https://longform.org/posts/longform-podcast-200-jack-hitt)
 - [Moby on Creative Mornings](https://creativemornings.com/podcast/episodes/moby)

Both talk about when to be an editor and when to just create for the sake of creating. Hitt describing his migration from being a writer to an editor really reminded me of my transition from being a full time Software Developer to a Site Reliability Engineer. Moby's thoughts on not editing at all until he shared made me really happy as well.

Cheers,
