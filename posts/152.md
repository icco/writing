So much #inspiration today. Or at least content to get me thinking about things. @niket and I had a chat on Wednesday (someone remind me to write a blog post on how I keep in touch with people), and one person that came up was his friend [Gary Chou](https://garychou.com/). This morning I had an email introducing us, which led me into internet stalker mode. Who is this guy? I had researched [Orbital 1k](https://web.archive.org/web/20220818174836/https://orbitalnyc.com/1k/) a little, but that's all I knew.

What I discovered was actually the pinned tweet on @garychou.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;Have a thesis for how you want to spend the heartbeats of your life.&quot; <a href="https://t.co/9nvIgjmRC1">https://t.co/9nvIgjmRC1</a></p>&mdash; Gary Chou (@garychou) <a href="https://twitter.com/garychou/status/601749827307839488">May 22, 2015</a></blockquote>

This, plus an article my mom had emailed me sent me down a path I seem to go down every year once graduation season rolls into town: lets read people's suggestions on how to live life. I found the following articles (many linked from each other) to be quite interesting and thought provoking:

Also, just looking through the projects on [SVA's IXD Festival](https://web.archive.org/web/20250326031210/https://www.festival.interactiondesign.sva.edu/) was cool.

So what did that inspire me to do? For some reason, redesign some of my personal stuff, specifically [my resume](http://natwelch.com/resume). In fact I lost most of the day to that.

It looks like [this](http://cl.ly/bGzx/d) today, but it will [soon](https://github.com/icco/Resume/pull/4) look like [this](http://cl.ly/bGhJ/d).

Thanks to @mrmrs_ for all the CSS tips.

I also tried to see the sunset again today, but there were too many clouds. I also started watching [My Little Monster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Monster) on Netflix. It's a little too slice of life for me, but who knows, I've been in an anime mood, so I might just power through.
