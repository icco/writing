It's time for a #happy post. Maybe next week I'll get it done on a Saturday... but what is time?

[The New York Times interviewed John Lilly](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/23/business/john-lilly-simplify-your-message-and-repeat-often.html). I met @johnolilly earlier this year, and I really enjoy the things he has to say in general. I particularly liked the advice at the end of this article.

 > One is, to use the words of my colleague Reid Hoffman at Greylock, find your tribe. You should look around and figure out whose team you’re on and whose team you’re not on. And for the people whose team you want to be on, you need to invest in those relationships and treat them well and spend time with them. The choices you make on who you stand with, and who you stand against, will matter.

 > The other thing I would say is to stay close to professions that create and make things, and stay away from derivative professions like finance. I think makers increasingly have the power in our society.

[The Best Wi-Fi Mesh Networking Kits for Most People by The Wirecutter](http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-wi-fi-mesh-networking-kits/) is pretty great, although I wish they had waited a few days to get in [Google WiFi](http://www.theverge.com/2016/12/6/13843536/google-wifi-review-mesh-router-system-vs-eero).

I'm really excited that @Lin_Manuel and @PatrickRothfuss are working together: [Lin-Manuel Miranda’s ‘Kingkiller Chronicle’ Adaptation: 5 Things to Know](http://www.thewrap.com/lin-manuel-mirandas-kingkiller-chronicle-adaptation-5-things-know/)

[First 15 – OlliOlli: Epic Combo Edition](https://www.penny-arcade.com/patv/episode/olliolli-epic-combo-edition) made me laugh. Plus OlliOlli is a fun game.

I love @lessig, so his announcement of [The Electors Trust](https://medium.com/@lessig/the-electors-trust-7af58d87c2bd) made me pretty excited. 

[An Open Letter to DNC Chair Candidates on the Future of Tech for Our Party](https://medium.com/@joshhendler/an-open-letter-to-dnc-chair-candidates-on-the-future-of-tech-for-our-party-1afd14f77402) is probably one of the better writeups of tech and the democratic party. It's a shitshow, and needs a lot of help. I think this is a good step in the right direction.

Also, @baconmeteor's writeup of [Notes from November 28 meetup of Bay Area Tech Solidarity](https://sfbay.techsolidarity.org/2016/11/28/meeting_notes.htm) was really good if you're interested in tech and politics right now.

I love reading people's blog posts about their time at @recursecenter. It's always a bit inspiring to see what people are reading and working on. Two I read this week:

 - [RC week 1000](http://kracekumar.com/post/153759852775/rc-week-1000) by @kracetheking
 - [Week 1: Staying On Track](https://blog.stanzheng.com/recurse/week-1/) by @stanzheng

I enjoyed the designs in @Architizer's [Maker Park: Reimagining North Brooklyn's Waterfront as a Vibrant Creative Hub](http://architizer.com/blog/maker-park/).


[How I Keep Tech in Check](https://journal.thriveglobal.com/ev-williams-how-i-keep-tech-in-check-f7964e63c02d#.pyrspkpj9) by @ev was nice. I constantly struggle with this, and this article provided some good suggestions.

[New Rule: All Purchases Subject to a 7-Day Mental Quarantine](http://nyti.ms/29tYSml) is in that same category. I've been doing a lot of stress purchasing these last few months. I think this will hopefully save me some money.

[Editors](http://web.mit.edu/kolya/misc/txt/editors) is a history of Vim, which is a fun read if that's your editor of choice.

I hope you have a great week!

Cheers.
