Another #happy post. I hope everyone is doing well.

Read

- [Uber's Crazy YOLO App Rewrite](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/uber-app-rewrite-yolo/) is a story of a terrible sounding rewrite. We did a big rewrite last year, and it was thankfully nothing like this.
- [Making Truth Social Comply With The AGPL](https://boehs.org/node/truth-social) is just an interesting walkthrough of someone trying to enforce a license on open source software.
- [Stop Acting Like You're Famous](https://ajkprojects.com/stopactinglikeyourefamous) is great advice on how to make your leisure activities more enjoyable.
- [HiSense TV crashes persons computer](https://cohost.org/bravemule/post/5638478-empty). What a fun little mystery bug. Computers were a mistake.

Listen

- [Dropbox CEO on Decoder Podcast](https://www.theverge.com/24128606/dropbox-drew-houston-ai-remote-work-virtual-organization) was an interesting dive into the current state of remote work. I'm not sure I agree with everything he says, but it's interesting to hear his perspective.

Watch

 - I watched most of [Fallout](). Look, the show is good. It's a bit terrifying, disgusting and a little funny. Mostly I'm just amazed they made such a great adaptation.

Play

 - I was in London over the weekend helping Mel find a place to live for the year. Fun to be back in the city and wandering around.
