 * [Server-agnostic logging of DNS queries/responses](http://jpmens.net/2013/05/27/server-agnostic-logging-of-dns-queries-responses/)
 * [Dashboards for Graphite - Dashboard Dude](http://dashboarddude.com/blog/2013/01/23/dashboards-for-graphite/)
 * [Riemann - A network monitoring system](http://riemann.io/)
