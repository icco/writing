It's #happy time!


I've been enjoying [The Outline's World Dispatch](https://theoutline.com/post/1359/the-outline-world-dispatch). It's a good daily podcast that is entertaining and not pure news, which is nice.

I stumbled across this and enjoyed the memory of when we didn't know what was going to happen: [Last Days of The Pirate Bay](https://max.computer/blog/last-days-of-the-pirate-bay/).


Two more solid @recursecenter retrospectives:

 - [My experience at Recurse Center](http://sabelo.io/?p=950) by @sabelonow
 - [Never graduate! Reflections on Recurse Center](http://digitalfreepen.com/2017/08/25/never-graduate-reflections-recurse.html) by @digitalfreepen

[One Way To Deconstruct There Will Be Blood — Or Any Movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KlopLcNC1Y&feature=youtu.be) was a fascinating walk through of one way to analyze films.

I love that [Who The Hill](https://github.com/newsdev/who_the_hill), a MMS-based facial recognition service for members of Congress, exists.

Yay! [V.E. Schwab signs a $1M deal with Tor Books](http://ew.com/books/2017/08/28/v-e-schwab-signs-1m-deal-with-tor-books/amp/). I love her books.

I found this fascinating: [National Weather Service Adds New Colors So It Can Map Harvey's Rains](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/08/28/546776542/national-weather-service-adds-new-colors-so-it-can-map-harveys-rains).

Google's [rendertron](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/rendertron), a dockerized, headless Chrome rendering solution, is very cool. Also, I enjoyed reading about [nsheridan/cashier: A self-service CA for OpenSSH](https://github.com/nsheridan/cashier).

I always love Backblaze's [Hard Drive Reliability](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/hard-drive-failure-stats-q2-2017/) articles. I also recently reread their article on [Cloud Infrastructure Costs](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/cost-of-cloud-storage/).

[The Biggest Misconception About Today’s College Students - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/28/opinion/community-college-misconception.html)

[Fire ants survive Houston flooding by creating terrifying rafts made of their bodies](http://mashable.com/2017/08/28/fire-ants-float-houston-flood-harvey/#vmsWDejWEiq3) is hardcore frightening.

[A camera that prints a GIF instantly](https://imgur.com/gallery/CG9w4) is a cool concept.

A gentle reminder that Amazon Wishlists are public by default: [Here Are a Bunch of Trump Inner Circle Amazon Wish Lists](https://www.wired.com/story/trump-world-amazon-wish-lists)

NYT had an excellent retrospective on Princess Diana: [Diana’s Legacy: A Reshaped Monarchy, a More Emotional U.K.](https://nyti.ms/2wpNrnD)

Ars wrote up a weird thing about [the comments written to the FCC about Net Neutrality](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/08/isp-funded-study-finds-huge-support-for-keeping-current-net-neutrality-rules/).

I don't know if this is real, but damn, so neat if it is: [a Juice company dumped orange peels in a deforested area.](http://shareably.co/juice-company-orange-peels/?tse_id=INF_bdf682f08b3b11e7a7253d7eefa2109b)

Preach! [A Rant on Usable Security](https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/a-rant-on-usable-security/)

[This 7,541-Piece Millennium Falcon Is the Largest, Most Desirable Lego Set Ever Created](https://io9.gizmodo.com/this-7-541-piece-millennium-falcon-is-the-largest-most-1798426562).

Refinery29 has an excellent list of [Weekend Getaways From NYC](http://www.refinery29.com/day-trips-around-nyc)

I enjoyed this write-up on the current state of the Russia election scandal by the NYT: [Russian Election Hacking Efforts, Wider Than Previously Known, Draw Little Scrutiny](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/01/us/politics/russia-election-hacking.html)

[What if I Bombed at My Own Wedding?](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/09/01/opinion/sunday/what-if-i-bombed-at-my-own-wedding.html?_r=0&referer=https://t.co/QdAhICJMO6?amp=1) is cute.

This tweet made me think: <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It&#39;s weird to live in an era of unprecedented tech progress knowing historians will probably frame everything in terms of climate change.</p>&mdash; Paul Ford (@ftrain) <a href="https://twitter.com/ftrain/status/903985756640866307">September 2, 2017</a></blockquote>

[Taylor Swift Unveils Even Darker Persona With New Single ‘Skullfucking Maggot Shit Boyfriend’](http://www.theonion.com/article/taylor-swift-unveils-even-darker-persona-new-singl-56826).

Look, I love Gossip Girl, and enjoyed VanityFair's [Gossip Girl 10 Years Later](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/08/gossip-girl-ten-year-anniversary/amp) article.

Have a great week!
