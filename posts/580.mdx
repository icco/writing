Ok! Another late #happy post...!


I introduced @rohenpeterson to [Fuck, That's Delicious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEWh_6FJMh4&feature=youtu.be) this week, and he's hooked.

@alexbaldwin continues to dominate the robot curation of EDM world with his most recent bot:

[Jimmy Fallon Pays Tribute to Prince](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9iVXxFt1Wg&feature=youtu.be) is a funny story I've heard before, but [D'Angelo ft. Princess: Sometimes It Snows in April](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uzBHhPEWpE&feature=youtu.be) is completely stuck in my head. Such a beautiful rendition of a song I had never heard before Prince's death.

Speaking of Prince, the NYT wrote up the video is what I always think of when I think of Prince: [The Day Princeâ€™s Guitar Wept the Loudest](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/28/arts/music/prince-guitar-rock-hall-of-fame.html?smid=fb-nytimes&smtyp=cur).

I also missed the 2020 Olympics logo controversy, but I really liked [the new logo they chose](http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/04/25/national/checkered-pattern-chosen-as-official-logo-for-2020-tokyo-olympic-games/).


That's it, have a great week!
