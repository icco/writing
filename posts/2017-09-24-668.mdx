I'm procrastinating on a few things, so I figure it's time to write a #happy post.

Let us start with something silly: [I’m Diana From Anne of Green Gables, and I am Fucking Drunk](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/im-diana-from-anne-of-green-gables-and-i-am-fucking-drunk)

Next, we can transition to the news that one of my favorite comedians is getting a show: [Jessica Williams as a sci-fi writer in Brooklyn](https://shadowandact.com/jessica-williams-showtime-show). Oh also related, [Questlove is making another book](http://www.thefader.com/2017/09/20/questlove-creative-quest). And I love me some Questlove.

Then, weird book nerd scandal: [The Handbook for Mortals Bestseller List Scandal](https://jezebel.com/the-handbook-for-mortals-bestseller-list-scandal-is-the-1798428267)

If you like [Reply All](https://gimletmedia.com/reply-all/), or just hearing about how podcasts are made Episode 262 of Longform was great:

 - [Alex Goldman of Reply All (Part 1)](https://longform.org/posts/longform-podcast-262-alex-goldman-of-reply-all-part-1)
 - [PJ Vogt of Reply All (Part 2)](https://longform.org/posts/longform-podcast-262-pj-vogt-of-reply-all-part-2)

[My Three Years in Identity Theft Hell - Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-13/my-three-years-in-identity-theft-hell) is depressing, but an interesting look on how messed up the credit industry in the US is.

Two fantastic articles about people's time at @recursecenter, but both a few years after they attended:

 - [What I Learned at RC: Two Years Late?](http://blog.annharter.com/2017/09/16/What-I-Learned-at-RC.html) by @anyharder
 - [How I spent my time at the Recurse Center - Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/09/17/how-i-spent-my-time-at-the-recurse-center/) by @b0rk

[Spain and Catalonia Wrestle Over `.cat` Internet Domain](https://nytimes.com/2017/09/22/style/cat-domain-catalonia.html) is just weird.

[Hal Ruzal Grades Your Bike Locking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTA3JsZWiec&feature=youtu.be) is a great video on how to make sure your bike doesn't get stolen.

[The xx - On Hold (Jamie xx Remix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYvEhgYy35I&feature=youtu.be) is just a solid remix.

[Why Shanghai might be the next Silicon Valley](https://startupsventurecapital.com/why-shanghai-china-might-be-the-next-silicon-valley-and-why-we-should-care-811672cb12dd) is a reasonable article and talks about how [The Great Firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Shield_Project) has affected technical innovation.

Sparkfun has written up some fun blog posts about hardware and security:

 - [Building a Safe Cracking Robot](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/building-a-safe-cracking-robot)
 - [Gas Pump Skimmers](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/gas-pump-skimmers)

The NYT [wrote an article about Loftium](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/18/your-money/mortgages/loftium-airbnb-down-payment.html?_r=0). The service tries to help you buy a home, in exchange for a promise you will list your home on Airbnb.

[30 Days Timelapse at Sea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHrCI9eSJGQ&feature=youtu.be) is beautiful video.

[What the Rich Won’t Tell You](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/08/opinion/sunday/what-the-rich-wont-tell-you.html?_r=1) was a good read. Makes sense, and not too shocking, but needs to be said in this world of Trump bullshit.

[Warren Buffett won a $1M bet that the S&P 500 stock index would outperform hedge funds over a decade](https://www.aei.org/publication/warren-buffett-wins-1m-bet-made-a-decade-ago-that-the-sp-500-stock-index-would-outperform-hedge-funds/).

[Designing For the Margins](http://gwendolyn.io/designing-for-the-margins-affectconf-takeaways/) is an excellent conference summary.

I love reading about NTP, so [a comparison of NTP implementations](https://chrony.tuxfamily.org/comparison.html) was neat.
 
I am super excited for APFS, so [a Backup Software Developer's Perspective on APFS](https://macdaddy.io/apfs-backup-software-developers-perspective/) was neat.

[Relicensing React, Jest, Flow, and Immutable.js](https://code.facebook.com/posts/300798627056246/relicensing-react-jest-flow-and-immutable-js/) is proof that if enough people rant about a thing, a company may change their minds.

I started migrating a lot of my stuff away from CloudFlare and Heroku. I am moving to a Kubernetes cluster, so [automated certificate provisioning in Kubernetes using kube-lego](https://blog.jetstack.io/blog/kube-lego/) was a useful read. https://natwelch.com, https://hello.natwelch.com, https://quotes.natwelch.com, and https://walls.natwelch.com have all moved over. I've got a long list of apps to follow that.

[danluu/post-mortems is a beautiful collection of postmortems](https://github.com/danluu/post-mortems). I read through a bunch of these while doing research one morning.

[Pytosquatting](https://www.pytosquatting.org/) is interesting, but what's exciting is the work on a new system for hosting all Python packages called Warehouse. It's running now at https://pypi.org/.

[Public Money Should Produce Public Code](https://publiccode.eu/) is something that I feel very strongly about. It's not going to happen in the US anytime soon, but the EU is pushing forward.

[Bunnie Huang and Ed Snowden describe a malware-resistant hardware iPhone privacy overlay](https://boingboing.net/2017/09/08/impaired-judgment-phones.html) is an exciting project.

I am now a subscriber to [Offscreen Magazine](https://www.offscreenmag.com/), and read both [Issue 16](https://www.offscreenmag.com/issues/16) and [Issue 17](https://www.offscreenmag.com/issues/17) this week. They were both good reads.

Have a great week!
