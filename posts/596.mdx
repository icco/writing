Hey all, #happy time.

I watched two animated animal films this week:

 - [Zootopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zootopia)
 - [The Secret Life of Pets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_Life_of_Pets)

Both were good #movies, although Pets was much more aimed at children, and Zootopia feels like a movie I can recommend to anyone. If you had to pick one, I'd say go see Zootopia. It deserves to win animated film of the year.

In work related things, I loved reading the [profile of Google disaster-recovery-testing boss Kripa Krishnan](http://www.businessinsider.com/profile-of-google-disaster-recovery-testing-boss-kripa-krishnan-2016-8). DiRT was one of my favorite things at Google, and Kripa is amazing.

I really enjoyed @theGrugq's [Cyber Showdown](https://grugq.tumblr.com/post/148394704908/cyber-showdown). I've been thinking about it all day, and I think I need to write a full post on my thoughts, but at the base level, I completely agree with what this post is saying.

I am quite enjoying the ["First Seven Jobs"](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/595) meme.

[Storing Pok√©mon without SQL](https://eev.ee/blog/2016/08/05/storing-pok%C3%A9mon-without-sql/) was a nice writeup of someone walking through their thought process while designing a storage system for a certain type of data.

If you ignore the marketing, @chrismessina's [I am a process](https://medium.com/chris-messina/i-am-a-process-354d0b2a2c7b#.htu6tolxk) was pretty good.

I love Milton Glaser, and I'm excited about his most recent project: [Milton Glaser Wants You to Prove You Exist](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-06/milton-glaser-wants-you-to-prove-you-exist).

Finally, I spent about a year in college designing a text editor, so discovering this page was a total nerdgasam: [TextEditors Wiki: Designing Text Editors](http://texteditors.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?DesigningTextEditors).

Have a great week!
