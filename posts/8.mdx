I'm trying to "get my shit together" as they say. I have no idea how to actually do that, but here is a list of things I am trying:

 - Waking up at a semi-consistent time.
 - Eating breakfast
 - Stretching and trying to improve my posture
 - Spending more time in the morning writing and coding
 - Coming up with ways to make my goals more measurable
 - Using those measurable goals as steps towards yearly, life, and long term goals.

I don't have a comment section on this site. I'm not even tweeting posts yet, so no one will know about it, probably. But if you know me and this is something you have opinions about. Reach out to me.
