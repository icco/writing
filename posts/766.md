I read [Amanda Litman's Thankful List](https://open.substack.com/pub/amandalitman/p/a-gratitude-list) and figured I'd write a similar post. Last year I made [a post](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/749) like this. Might as well continue.

This year I am thankful for...

- The health of my family and friends. It's not always great, but we keep trying.
- The Ocean and all of its creatures.
- Wikipedia. Shared knowledge is invaluable.
- Emergency and disaster first responders. The only constant is things will fail, and people will need saving. Thanks for your hard work.
- The folks who grow our food. We can't stay healthy without it.
- My job. It's a complicated pile of stress and chaos, but it's still one of the best jobs I've had.
- The [tzdb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database) and [Paul Eggert](https://samueli.ucla.edu/people/paul-eggert/).
- All of the small communities I am apart of on the internet. RC, Merveilles, Gunks, Time Owls, Ops Party, The Waystone, Nerd Chat, etc. Y'all make the chaos bearable.


Thank you for reading. Lots of love.
