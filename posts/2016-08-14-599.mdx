Sunday #happy link post.

One day, I will meet @jxnblk, until then I can just marvel at all the cool stuff he puts out, like the most recent [gravitons](https://github.com/jxnblk/gravitons).

This is so beautiful. I'm just in awe. [Anna Wintour’s Wild Garden](http://nyti.ms/2bdNt7q).

My [work has a podcast now](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/page/podcast/?ref=natops). The first episode is @HillaryClinton talking to @maxlinsky. It's neat.

@aaronpk, of #indieweb fame, wrote a nice article titled "[Why I Live in IRC](https://aaronparecki.com/2015/08/29/8/why-i-live-in-irc)". It's a year old, but still great.

[How to Have Healthy Relationships as a Developer](http://smo.nu/how-to-have-healthy-relationships-as-a-developer/) is an article that I like on work/life balance.

The US Goverment released their [Federal Source Code Policy](https://sourcecode.cio.gov/). Great steps in the right direction.

I've only skimmed it, but [Human collective intelligence as distributed Bayesian inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.01987) looks to be a fun paper.

"[Kids can now learn to code with Pocky, the delicious Japanese snack](http://www.theverge.com/2016/8/5/12387456/glicode-pocky-coding-game-japan)". What a time to be alive.

"[I Peeked Into My Node_Modules Directory And You Won’t Believe What Happened Next](https://medium.com/friendship-dot-js/i-peeked-into-my-node-modules-directory-and-you-wont-believe-what-happened-next-b89f63d21558)" was interesting because on first read through, I didn't realize it was satire, and started researching all of this, only to realize I have a really low opinion of the Javascript community.

"[What can architects learn from No Man’s Sky?](https://killscreen.com/articles/can-architects-learn-no-mans-sky/)" is a decent think piece. I always love the concept that video game design can affect the real world.

Have a great week!
