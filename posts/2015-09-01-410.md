> I still don’t understand award shows, I don’t understand how they get five people who work their entire life, won, sold records, sold concert tickets, to come stand on a carpet and for the first time in they live be judged on a chopping block and have the opportunity to be considered a loser. I don’t understand it bro. I don’t understand when the biggest album or the biggest video, I still don’t understand it, I been conflicted bro, I just wanted people to like me more. But fuck that bro! -- [Kanye West, MTV VMAs 2015-08-30](http://genius.com/Kanye-west-mtv-vmas-2015-vanguard-acceptance-speech-lyrics/)

Maybe not the most eloquent speech, but pretty solid ideas.
