So the first quarter of 2016 is over. As such, it's time to reflect. 

Looking back at my [2015 year in review](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/531), I've pulled out my goals for 2016. They weren't really broken up into objectives and key results. Instead they were just a list of measurable changes I wanted to make. I'm going to try taking them and restructure them into something a little more comprehensible moving forward.

So here are my Objectives, and their Key Results as I defined them at the beginning for this year. The objectives are new, the results are from that year in review post.

 - **Improve physical health**
   - Lose thirty pounds of weight
   - Be active (elevated heart rate) for two hours per week on average

 - **Ship more side projects and be creative**
   - Take in revenue from one side project
   - Participate in 100:10:1

 - **Grow culturally**
   - Travel to five cities you haven’t been to before, or at least not in five years.
   - Read seventy books

Alright, so I'm actually doing pretty well on some of these, but horribly on others. Let's break it down. 

## Improve physical health

I am doing horribly here. I'm not walking as much since I have a shorter commute. I haven't been weighing myself, and I'm definitely not getting the sustained elevated heart rate I need.

I am wearing a Fitbit regularly though, so that's interesting.

Some slightly different goals here might be in order. I'm going to keep the weight thing. That's something I just need to get on. But instead of elevated heart rate, I'm going to aim for thirty minutes of running, three times a week. I liked reading the [NYT How to Start Running Guide](http://www.nytimes.com/well/guides/how-to-start-running), so I'm going to try following that. It's in my calendar and everything.

I also want to add a goal of stretching every morning. I don't know how I'm going to measure that, beyond just saying it, but I always feel better when I stretch after I wake up.

## Ship more side projects and be creative

Ok, so I'm doing ok here. I haven't taken in any revenue from a side project, but I did formalize and start 100:10:1. I've been writing [every week about my progress](https://writing.natwelch.com/tags/tenbysix). My progress twelve weeks in isn't great. I think a lot of it is due to an unwillingness to just sit down and power through things. I also miss having a whiteboard in my apartment for sketching out ideas, but that's a poor excuse, given that I have my notebook. As proof to my procrastination, I am writing this post instead of coding on 100:10:1 right now...

I'm going to modify my KRs for this objective as well to break out the three parts of 100:10:1. I also want to add something about writing. Maybe number of posts made in 2016? I can add that to the [stats page](https://writing.natwelch.com/stats) to track. Let's say 200 posts made in 2016, and a four post per week average. I will write some code for this.
 
## Grow culturally

Well I haven't left New York since the new year, so obviously haven't made progress on my travel goal. But I have read nineteen books so far, so am very much on track to hit seventy by the end of the year.

One thing that isn't on my goals, that I have been doing, is going to see movies and art exhibits. I don't really keep track of this beyond foursquare checkins though. In the first three months of 2016, I went to museums, galleries or theaters thirteen times. This is lower than it was in 2015 for sure, just due to my work schedule, but it's a good thing overall. If I aim for five art things a month, I think I will be in a good place.

Art things so far this year that I have in Foursquare:

January:

 - Joy @ Nitehawk Cinema
 - Oakland Museum of California
 - The Big Short
 - The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2

February:

 - Deadpool
 - MoMa
 - Whitney
 - Swann Galleries

March:

 - The Boy and the Beast
 - Whitney
 - The Revenant
 - New-York Historical Society Museum & Library

## New Goals

So adjusted 2016 goals:

 - **Improve physical health**
   - Lose thirty pounds of weight
   - Run for thirty minutes, three times a week
   - Be able to run four miles without stopping
   - Stretch every morning

 - **Ship more side projects and be creative**
   - Take in revenue from one side project
   - Participate in 100:10:1 (Create a list of 100 projects, build MVP of 10 by June, and a fully flushed out project by EOY)
   - Write 200 posts in 2016, 
   - Maintain a four post per week average on https://writing.natwelch.com

 - **Grow culturally**
   - Travel to five cities you haven’t been to before, or at least not in five years.
   - Read seventy books
   - Go to five art exhibits, live shows or movies a month

Onwards to Q2!
