Ok, another week, try number two to see if this #happy thing is gonna be a thing.

Let's go backwards. First off, [this article about fall](http://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/its-decorative-gourd-season-motherfuckers) linked to me by @smittyhalibut has me rolling in laughter. So good. It caused [me to try out Twitter's new poll thing](https://twitter.com/icco/status/657936870140190721).

The [Longform Podcast](https://longform.org/podcast) continues to be amazing. This week, [their interview of Matthew Shear](https://longform.org/posts/longform-podcast-163-matthew-shaer) was really fascinating talking about Shear's life as a freelancer and how that affects his family life.

Finally, I've been reading [Seveneves](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22752699-seveneves). This book is so fantastic if you like science fiction, space, world building and engineering. Highly recommend.

Oh and last week was lost almost entirely to Destiny, which is ok, because now a I am a golden god. Or at least it looks like I'm covered in gold.
