  Day 59: Jobs, VR, and finally, tag aliases! Plus, Google App Engine deployment
  woes. A day of building and breaking. #recursecenter
---

Friday! I talked to @reed and @jollysonali (in two unrelated separate conversations) about jobs, life, hiring people, building companies and other random stuff. 

I also met with @DavidKosslyn about his VR company and talked shop.

In the evening I added tag alias support to my blog, finally. But then, as expect, Google broke the ability to deploy to App Engine with their tools again. Oh well. No deploying for me.
