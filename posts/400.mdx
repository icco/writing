So, [Ableton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ableton) put together this video of one of my favorite bands, [Battles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battles_(band)), on [how they create music](https://youtu.be/jS5ltxihivA).

Battles uses all kinds of crazy loops and stuff to make their music. The [accompanying blog article](https://www.ableton.com/en/blog/battles-art-of-repetition/) has a quote that kind of summarizes the weird sorts of things they are doing:

 > I like to get sort of funky with it by re-sampling the sample. You can send one audio loop, say, re-record it onto three tracks, into three clip slots, and then in those three clips slots you can play with the start point. I like to do this thing – and I've made a lot of loops using this technique – it's almost like beat-juggling as a DJ, but you're just doing the speaker on-off trick. So you're bouncing between the three loops – it's the exact same sample on all three tracks – and if the start points are slightly different you can get into some really cool dancing kind of rhythms. - [Ian Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Williams_(musician))

The [Song Exploder](http://songexploder.net/) episodes for [Anamanaguchi](http://songexploder.net/anamanaguchi), [The Album Leaf](http://songexploder.net/the-album-leaf), [Baths](http://songexploder.net/baths) and [Tycho](http://songexploder.net/tycho) also talk about creating loops in music. All of this is pretty cool. Makes me want to get my act together again and finish building my drum machine.
