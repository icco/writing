The internet is providing us with more and more information. I love this. At the same time, I think it's really hurting people who don't understand they have to filter everything they hear and read. No one is the perfect source anymore. The truth comes from combining multiple sources and figuring out what is really going on.

Maybe we need better tools to do that.
