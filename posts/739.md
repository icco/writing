Here's another #happy post for you! I wrote this from the sunny shores of the Bahamas, so I'm doing particularly well.

Watch

 - [Hong Kong’s Legendary Whole-Roasted Goose](https://youtu.be/-XtYJz3uwW0?si=u-h_AR_qGT851cdy) is so fascinating. Street Eats by Bon Appétit continues to impress me.

Listen

 - [The Sunday Story: Answering Your Questions About Electric Vehicles](https://www.npr.org/2024/03/24/1198911299/answering-your-questions-about-electric-vehicles) is a fantastic episode of the NPR Sunday Story. I learned a lot about electric vehicles and it challenged a few misconceptions I had about EV production in the US.
 - [How to DIY a Music Career (with Amelia Meath and David Gray at SXSW)](https://switchedonpop.com/episodes/amelia-meath-david-gray-sxsw) is a great interview with Amelia Meath of Sylvan Esso. I love hearing about how musicians think about their careers. Also learned a bunch about David Gray's song Babylon.

Read

 - I enjoyed the short post "[Dear Paul Graham, there is no cookie banner law](https://www.amazingcto.com/cookie-banners-are-not-needed/)." I feel like I gave up on this fight ten years ago, but glad to see some folks are still at it.
 - I read all of [The Sword of Kaigen](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/41886271) by M.L. Wang. I was gifted this book by my friend Frankie and it is not at all what I expected. Is it a political thriller? A reimagining of The Last Airbender? A treatise on the dangers of propaganda? A character study on women in bad marriages? I think it's all of these things and more. It could have been 30% shorter, but it is beautifully written and I'd recommend to anyone who likes a bit of epic fantasy.
 - [FlightRadar describes their new GPS Jamming Map](https://www.flightradar24.com/blog/gps-jamming-map/) is pretty interesting.
 - [Dan Luu's Slow Device](https://danluu.com/slow-device/) writeup is super fascinating and very infuriating when you think about all of the companies that don't build for less powerful devices.
 - I've had a few times in my career where I've pushed back against folks using websockets. [This article](https://rxdb.info/articles/websockets-sse-polling-webrtc-webtransport.html) provides a great analysis of when to use which technology and lines up with my normal arguments.

Play

 -  I added [a theme switcher](https://github.com/icco/writing/pull/476) and [emoji](https://github.com/icco/writing/pull/582) support to my website! :tada: :rocket:

I hope you have a great week!
