[Pictogram](http://pictogram.agency/) did a neat little thing where they [turned Pokemon into logos](http://pictogram.agency/pokemonbranding/). 

[![beedrill](https://d13yacurqjgara.cloudfront.net/users/215/screenshots/1894928/beedrill800_1x.png)](https://dribbble.com/shots/1894928-Beedrill-Pokemon-reimagined-as-company-logos)

Discovered via [dribbble](https://dribbble.com/icco/likes). Perfect little light-hearted design to offset the internet hate in the previous post.
