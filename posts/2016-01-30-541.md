This week was great. Week 2 at the campaign, and I'm still #happy. At some point burnout will probably set in, but I've got time. In terms of media I consumed, there was some definite good stuff.

I started the week listening to the [Where There's Smoke's episode on will power](http://wheretheressmoke.libsyn.com/you-say-you-want-a-resolution-willpower). This was really interesting, it definitely put a spin on how I think about my goals and evaluating if I'll achieve them

I watched [this guy snowboard across NYC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRv7G7WpOoU&feature=youtu.be), which was a fun video making light of the fact that NY got dumped on over the weekend.

There were two great pieces on video games:

 - [Former Defense Secretary Marches Into New Territory: Videogames](http://www.wsj.com/articles/former-defense-secretary-marches-into-new-territory-videogames-1453483137?mod=e2tw)
 - [Mini Metro - First 15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlX29ynA0Fc&feature=youtu.be)

I haven't played Churchill's Solitaire, but it sounds like fun. I might try it on a deck of cards since there is no android version. And I love minimetro, I've mentioned it in past posts, and this review of it by the guys at Penny Arcade really point out its flaws and benefits.

I read through a lot of [IamA male model, AMA!](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/42ppqu/iama_male_model_ny_paris_from_the_period_of_the/) on reddit, which was comedic gold.

I came across two great personal websites as well, [Julie Ann Horvath](http://julieannhorvath.com/portfolio/) and [Susan Lin](http://bysusanlin.com/)

On Friday, @lara_hogan gave a great talk about [Designing for Performance](http://designingforperformance.com/) which was fantastic. I also learned about her amazing [Donut Manifesto](http://larahogan.me/donuts/). I learned so much from her!

In the world of politics, I enjoyed reading @newrepublic's [Is Nominating Bernie Sanders a Worthwhile Gamble?](https://newrepublic.com/article/128239/nominating-bernie-sanders-worthwhile-gamble) and [What Happens If Bernie Sanders Wins Iowa](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-happens-if-bernie-sanders-wins-iowa/) by @fivethirtyeight. Since before this election I never really followed primaries, I'm finding all the analysis of the competition really interesting. It's also basically necessary reading for me, so I know what the heck people are talking about. Speaking of which, another shout out for [NPR's Politics Podcast](http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510310/npr-politics-podcast), which doesn't let me link to individual episodes, but I've been really enjoying all of the content they have been putting out.

I hope you had a good week as well, and I wish you have an even better one next week!
