I'm currently sitting on a chair up in rainy Northern California. Listening to music, drinking coffee and browsing the internet. Political news has continued to be incredibly depressing, so let's focus on the #happy.

Yesterday I started working through [React for Beginners](https://reactforbeginners.com/). Such a great course. Really nice speed.

[Gomix](https://medium.com/gomix/introducing-gomix-aec205c421cb?source=ifttt--------------1) looks awesome. Been playing around with it lately, and it's a really neat way to code and deploy things.

[I'm going to start offering office hours](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/615), somewhat inspired by [Out of Office Hours](https://www.outofofficehours.com/) and [Draft](https://draft.nu/).

I've been skimming [The SIDtoday Files](https://github.com/firstlookmedia/sidtoday), which are interesting and scary. You can learn more about this at [The Intercept](https://theintercept.com/2016/05/16/what-its-like-to-read-the-nsas-newspaper-for-spies/).

I love best of lists. I'm weird like that. So my two favorite lists so far are:

* [Noisey's The 100 Best Albums of 2016](https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/the-100-best-albums-of-2016)
* [NPR's Best Books of 2016](http://apps.npr.org/best-books-2016/)

You'll probably see a post soon enough with all of my favorite best of lists...

@yuffster built [Dialog Tree](http://dialog.litany.io/). It's amazing. It takes time, but it's some of the most fun I've had playing with words in a long time.

Also I was backing in SF for a few days and got to see the @punchd crew, which was a blast.

Have a great week!
