It has been a very weird year. I am currently sitting in a coffee shop on the tenth floor of the Tate Modern, writing this blog post on my phone.

I am in a strange mood, and after reading [Gothamist's thankful for the MTA](https://gothamist.com/news/lets-give-thanks-to-nycs-troubled-transit-system), I wanted to list a few things I am #thankful for in my #life.


- I am thankful for public art and museums.
- I am thankful for video chat applications letting me see my wife every day, even when we're an ocean apart.
- I am thankful for my family and our cat.
- I am thankful for coffee and the prevalence of fake milks at coffee shops.
- I am thankful for investigative journalists.
- I am thankful cell phone networks letting me have data around the world.
- I am thankful for work, and time off from work.
- I am thankful for nature, especially when it survives in cities despite humanities attempts to thwart it.
- I am thankful for smaller online social interactions. Blogs, Mastodon, Zulip, Slack, Discord, etc.
