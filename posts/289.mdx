Some interesting articles I read yesterday. 

I really like the ideas behind GitTip, and I'm super happy that the CEO is trying to be truly transparent. I wonder if a better approach would be to record all interviews and just send them to wikileaks? 

Google is good at the internet? Who knew.

And finally, this article is kind of retarded, but I think the point the author is trying to get across is that you should be thinking about what you're doing with your time because your 20s is the peak of your life. Funny read, nonetheless.
