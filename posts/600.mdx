This is another post in my continuing series of things that I am consuming online that are making me #happy.

Hello from the Magic Tavern's [Office Bosses](http://hellofromthemagictavern.com/2015/10/12/32-offices-bosses/) was amazing. It's a fun parody on Dungeons and Dragons.

I didn't know this was a thing, but apparently there is a bot that is automating combining John Oliver's puppy justices and Supreme Court transcripts: [ALSchwalm/PuppyJusticeAutomated](https://github.com/ALSchwalm/PuppyJusticeAutomated). One of it's outputs, [Voisine v. United States: Oral Argument - February 29, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5lLpEG6AII&feature=youtu.be) is a fantastic watch.

Check out @mrmrs_ [marquee](http://mrmrs.io/marquee/) for a little plain text art.

[I Love You, But Our Happiness Doesn’t Fit My Personal Brand’s Narrative Strategy.](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/i-love-you-but-our-happiness-doesnt-fit-my-personal-brands-narrative-strategy) from @mcsweeneys is pretty hilarious, and maybe hits a little too close to home.

[NIST’s new password rules](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2016/08/18/nists-new-password-rules-what-you-need-to-know/) is a nice summary of the new suggestions on passwords from [NIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology).

[Beach rules](http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21705328-rumours-china-have-become-everyones-problem-beach-rules?fsrc=scn/tw/te/pe/ed/beachrules) is an article from the Economist talking about some crazy changes upcoming in politics in China. Interesting to see how this turns out.

[Day on a device](http://www.pierrebuttin.com/work/dayonadevice/) is a cool piece of art that I found thanks to @punchagan's [blog post on what he's reading](https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/what-i-liked-2016-07-10.html).

I really enjoyed the music on [XLR8R #449: Melodie](http://pca.st/NPGp).

[This is Your Life in Silicon Valley](https://medium.com/@subes01/this-is-your-life-in-silicon-valley-933091235095#.f1p1vjga2) is a decent summary of why I don't plan on moving back to the bay any time soon.

[It’s The Future](https://circleci.com/blog/its-the-future/) is a bit of satire, but also highlights a lot of the problems in the web infrastructure world right now.

Finally, I found out [an Olympian this year is an alumni from my high school](http://www.pressdemocrat.com/sports/5983992-181/gold-medalist-maya-dirado-visits)!

Have a great week everyone!
