I read this article by Valve named [Latency Compensating Methods in Client/Server In\-game Protocol Design and Optimization](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Latency_Compensating_Methods_in_Client/Server_In-game_Protocol_Design_and_Optimization). I need to reread it at least once or twice, but I think I'm getting the highlevel gist. Ken and I spent the day reading similar articles and possible ways to implement the ideas in our game.

We came to the high level idea that the client \(Javascript web game\) will send updates, essentially events saying "this just happened". The server will return an entire snapshot of the world \(or at least the world the user cares about\). We'll see how that implementation works out. I started doing a little work towards that.

Ken also changed the star generation algorithm, so the look is better now:
