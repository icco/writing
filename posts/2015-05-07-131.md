Spent most of the day preparing for RC's Job Fair. That meant spending time thinking about what I want for the future and questions that I wanted to ask companies. The question I came up with that I had the most fun asking was "Who at your company inspires you?". I want to use this more when talking to companies. I got a lot of interesting answers.

Before the Job Fair, Nick and Jesse led a bunch of us to an Arcade in China Town, which was fun.

The Job Fair was fun, I enjoyed talking to all of the companies. Lots of really interesting problems, people and stories.

Probably the most surprising company that was at the fair was [Flocabulary](https://www.flocabulary.com/). Flocabulary has an interesting take on education: creating rap music for kids to teach them things. They are in 25 percent of K-12 schools in the US, which was pretty cool as well.
