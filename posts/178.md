Tuesday was pretty low key. I shipped a package of stuff that wouldn't fit in my suitcase back to my parents, and had breakfast at Baz with John.

In the afternoon, I led a session on trying to quickly build a web app of John's design. It was like pair programming, but as Jesse better named it, mob programming. I coded on the projector and explained everything I was doing and people interjected here and there.

Tomorrow we're doing design, which I imagine will be much more contentious.

In the evening I ran movie night and showed people [Paprika](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0851578/). Still fantastic, still insane.
