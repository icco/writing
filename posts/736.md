A #happy post on time ish! Whee.

TV & Movies

-  I watched the [Bahrain GP](https://www.formula1.com/en/racing/2024/Bahrain.html). It was fun, but not an amazing race. I wish I had watched [the Tottenham game](https://youtu.be/2obL4gtlHC0?si=6eNJB2RuMmAq3dKr) instead.

Music

- Been listening to [Wall Of Eyes](https://open.spotify.com/album/6PdPOv5ybKZ9ZuGMk5iGZd?si=PkHghlcASauHzZxkkJCqmQ) by The Smile. It's basically a Radiohead album without being by Radiohead.

Read

- Our bookclub is reading [How to murder your employer](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/61272658) and it has been a delight. Would recommend.
- I read [this post on the history of Go](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/gos-early-growth-2012-2016-sameer-ajmani-oxtjc/) by Sameer Ajmani. It was fun and I'm looking forward to reading the rest of his posts.

Play

- I've gotten hooked on [Slay the Spire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slay_the_Spire). It's a rogue like with a card collecting gameplay. It's a hoot. I'm playing it on PS5, but it's on all of the systems.
