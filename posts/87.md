Day 2 in NYC. Three days till "Recurse Center" (man, I liked the name Hacker School so much better).

Spent most of the day trying to get a bunch of my finances in order and what not. Also spent a bunch of the day reading "[Exile](https://web.archive.org/web/20240119220014/https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66678.Exile)", which I am totally obsessed with.

I also took some time to [watch](https://www.flickr.com/photos/icco/16320069893/) a [fire burn](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/27/nyregion/reports-of-explosion-in-east-village.html?_r=0).

And I'm compiling a list of technical and non-fiction works I want to read and do book reports or something on:

 - Mary Rose Cook's [Git in six hundred words](http://maryrosecook.com/blog/post/git-in-six-hundred-words/) and [gitlet.js](http://gitlet.maryrosecook.com/docs/gitlet.html)
 - [Why We Fail](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18270942-why-we-fail)

 - [Interactive Data Visualization for the web](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16087610-interactive-data-visualization-for-the-web)
 - [Distributed Systems for Fun and Profit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18652140-distributed-systems-for-fun-and-profit)
 - [Beautiful Visualization](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7405941-beautiful-visualization)

 - [Time Management for System Administrators](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/376236.Time_Management_for_System_Administrators)
 - A bunch of technical papers, but haven't gone through my list yet to figure out which ones.
