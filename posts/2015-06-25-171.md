The end is neigh! 

I had a morning call with @niket. We talked about life, video games, why automating things is important, and other fun stuff.

I had a nice lunch with Sonali. We talk a lot about jobs, what I want, how to approach some of these companies.

I interviewed with [Nat](http://www.natthew.org/) at the Hillary Clinton campaign. I have mixed feelings about the interview. Definitly not my strongest technical interview.

@pamasaur had a great quote during an online chat, which I 100%!a(MISSING)gree with: "we so easily forget how long it took us to learn everything we have". 

@dmpatierno linked me to a segment of an interview with Bezon on [his regret minimalization framework](https://youtu.be/jwG_qR6XmDQ).

And finally, [my Code Words article on DDoS launched](https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/three/ddos-and-you). So excited for this to be out in the wild.

[Ashoka](https://twitter.com/ashokafinley) talked about building maps for the web. Both the history of the topic and the current problems. I found this super interesting. If I had a little more time, I might try to build a tile server.

[Ann](https://twitter.com/anyharder) approached me with this weird Ruby syntax I hadn't seen before:

```ruby
class Blah
  class << self
    attr_accessor :thing
  end
end
```

So I sat with her as we figured out what it meant and also explained the [Singleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern) and [Factory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern) design patterns. 

In the evening I went for a long walk with Eleanor down to Battery Park. Afterwards I had a phone call with a friend from SLO and he pitched me an idea. This kind of reminded me that I could extend my time being unemployed by doing some contracting work.
