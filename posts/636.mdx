Ok, I've been completely failing on writing and getting things done while I've been traveling. But today we need to change that.

Today I was added to the list of January Volunteers on [Out of Office Hours](https://www.outofofficehours.com/). Because of this, I've put up office hours for the next 30 days, and will be talking to people who sign up. The past few meetings have been great, so I'm really looking to talking to more folks.

In the coming days, I'll also be mailing out a scheduling signup link for people who are on [my newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/icco). I'm giving preferential treatment to the Out of Office Hours folks, just since they applied a while ago, but I'm also keeping my signups sliding, and have a lot of slots, so it should all work out.

You can read more about the idea behind offering office hours [on my blog](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/615).

I look forward to chatting with you.
