Hi Team\! #happy day\! I hope you're all doing well.

I've been really loving watching [Fleabag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleabag). Such an amazing and hilarious TV show.

[AR Subway Card/Map](https://www.tamrat.co/ar-subway-card-map/) by @tamrrat as really cool.

@aleffert is running for president and [he launched a podcast describing the crazy process](https://akivaforthepeople.com/podcast) of running for president.

[Minimising the Risk of Data Damage](https://benjiweber.co.uk/blog/2015/03/21/minimising-the-risk-of-data-damage/) is a fantastic article on doing safe changes in database designs.

[Invest 10% of your income, no matter what you earn](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/17/sallie-krawcheck-invest-10percent-of-your-income-no-matter-what-you-earn.html), this is pretty reasonable advice. Also in great financial advice, [Buy Yourself a F\*^king Latte](https://ritholtz.com/2019/04/buy-yourself-a-fking-latte/)

[aberke/city\-science\-bike\-swarm](https://github.com/aberke/city-science-bike-swarm): A swarm of bikes pulsating light in harmony take the city streets. You can see [more on her instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/BwNhO_lnBm-/).

[Allison Mack of ‘Smallville’ Pleads Guilty in Case of Nxivm ‘Sex Cult’](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/nyregion/nxivm-allison-mack.html). 

[Kubecost](https://medium.com/kubecost/introducing-kubecost-a-better-approach-to-kubernetes-cost-monitoring-b5450c3ae940?source=ifttt--------------1) is a tool for attempting to monitor cost in Kubernetes.

In podcasts, Game of Thrones is back\! Which means [Binge Mode is back covering GoT](https://www.theringer.com/binge-mode/2019/4/18/18485478/game-of-thrones-s8e1-winterfell)\! Also great were the two most recent Reply All episodes: [The Roman Mars Mazda Virus](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/brh8jm/140-the-roman-mars-mazda-virus) and [The Reply All Hotline](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/5whgo2/139-the-reply-all-hotline). 

Have a great week\!
