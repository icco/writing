So Google I/O was kind of amazing, the awesome part is that they gave me two
free phones. The bad part was how to get into talks. I really need to find more
conferences where they are either really old and experienced, or young without
a lot of people.

But that is all besides the point, thanks to Google I/O I started carrying a
smart phone. First a Droid (I sold that), then a Evo 4g (... it was taken to a
[better place][evotd]), and now a Nexus One. Since I've had mixed feelings
about carrying a smart phone, I decided a while ago to list the pros and cons.

# Pros

 * **GPS always at the ready** - with out this and google maps, I would have never found my way around Manhattan.
 * **Offline storage** - The ability to store things like barcodes and maps offline makes life a whole lot more paperless and easy.
 * **Address Book + Internet** - An address book that syncs with Facebook and Twitter makes it so I always have contact information for people
 * **Instant notification of new email** - Useful for knowing if the servers at work have died

# Cons

 * **Always on the internet** - This can be kind of distracting. I've found myself more often than not staring at my phone while waiting for something, instead of just thinking and waiting.
 * **Instant notification of new email** - I have no excuse for not seeing the servers are down.
 * **Battery Life** - No matter what anyone says, the battery life of smart phones suck. The nexus one lasts a little longer than a day under normal usage, but you basically need to plug it in every night. I miss just having to plug my phone in once a week, but maybe I'm spoiled.

Anyway, these are just my views. After my trip to NYC, I'm pretty set that the pros outweigh the cons, but if I were backpacking, I would need a cheap phone that would last for weeks to take with me,
