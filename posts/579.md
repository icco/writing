Yikes, I missed #tenbysix update number fourteen. [sadnat.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20240522150946/https://sadnat.com:443/). All that bravado [in number thirteen](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/576), and then just ball dropped.

## Stuff I worked on this week:

I wrote the client for [enki.garden](https://github.com/icco/enki.garden). I need to change my initial design after some research. My first pass that I build this weekend creates a json file with data about every file on my computer. But running `tree -if /` showed that I had over 2.5 million files on my personal laptop... which is a large json file, even when compressed (about 30Mb compressed). I tried [Gob](https://blog.golang.org/gobs-of-data) (this is all written in go), but it was equally large. I'm going to try [Gorilla ProtoRPC](http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/pkg/rpc/protorpc) next, because Google App Engine doesn't support [golang's net/rpc](https://golang.org/pkg/net/rpc/). But I think that's going to be just as bad.

I also haven't figured out how to tell the server a file has been deleted, because right now the client has no state... all the state is in the server.


I also worked on [Forgetful](https://github.com/icco/forgetful), and got a basic service that took any text you highlighted in OS X (using [Automator](http://thenextweb.com/lifehacks/2011/06/07/how-to-create-mac-os-x-services-with-automator/)) and wrote it to a simple web server. It has no authentication or what not, but it's a simple service running locally now.
