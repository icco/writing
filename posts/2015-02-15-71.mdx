More #kanye talk:

After Kanye released his movie for [Runaway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jg5wkZ-dJXA) in 2013, younger artists have been following suit, often creating larger art pieces to go with their album launches:

* Childish Gambino released [a screenplay to read](http://genius.com/albums/Childish-gambino/Because-the-internet-screenplay) with his [Because the Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Because_the_Internet) release\. Sadly the original version at becausetheinter.net is down, but genius.com has a decent copy.
* Drake created [Jungle](https://vimeo.com/119416353) to pre\-release his new mixtape [If You're Reading This It's Too Late](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_You%27re_Reading_This_It%27s_Too_Late).

All three try and give some sort of hint of the mental state and type of energy the artist was in while creating the album, or at least try and give us some visual ambiance to go with the music.

It should be noted that artists like [Björk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Björk) have been doing this for their entire career \(she does an art exhibit with almost every release\), as have many other artists since the early sixties.
