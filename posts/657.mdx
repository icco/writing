A late night #happy post. I spent the weekend rearranging and organizing the apartment with @mel_cantrell. It's slowly starting to feel like home. But let's talk about things I consumed, not things I did!

I loved [Wonder Woman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Woman_(2017_film)). I think all the hype is deserved. It was a good action movie, well done, had great writing and well done action scenes.


It's E3 season, so lots of video game trailers making me remember how much I love the medium currently:

 - [E3 2017: All the trailers from EA Play](https://www.polygon.com/e3/2017/6/10/15776302/e3-2017-ea-play-trailers)
 - [Here's The Latest Kingdom Hearts III Trailer](https://kotaku.com/heres-the-latest-kingdom-hearts-iii-trailer-1795994415)

[False Knees](http://www.falseknees.com) is a webcomic that @Yuffster shared. It's hilarious and fantastic and I love it. I also really enjoyed this comic: [It’s the End of the World - Again](https://thenib.com/it-s-the-end-of-the-world-again?t=recent).

[Sure, He’s Good at Basketball, but How Are His Twitter Skills?](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/06/06/sports/basketball/sure-hes-good-at-basketball-but-how-are-his-twitter-skills.html?_r=0&referer=https://t.co/33QavrxOwz?amp=1) really spoke to me. It's something I hadn't really thought about, but makes a ton of sense at how different sports leagues have different marketing strategies and which are working better with certain generations.

[RIP actor Adam West](http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/10/celebrities/obit-adam-west/index.html).

Look, I love clocks, and here's an old list of [Weird Internet Clocks](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/12/say-goodbye-to-2014-with-these-weird-internet-clocks/384015/).

Controversy alert: [The 25 Best Films of the 21st Century So Far](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/09/movies/the-25-best-films-of-the-21st-century.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur&_r=0). I've only seen about half of these, but do want to see them all.

Spent far too much time thinking about the things James Comey said this week:

 - [NYTimes: Full Transcript and Video: James Comey’s Testimony on Capitol Hill](https://nyti.ms/2rZXsrn)
 - [Read James Comey’s Prepared Remarks for Testimony](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/07/us/politics/document-Comey-Prepared-Remarks-Testimony.html)

I had never heard about how few drivers in NY get prosecuted for hitting pedestrians... which is kind of scary. [NYC Drivers Injured 1,083 Pedestrians and Cyclists in March, and Killed 12](http://nyc.streetsblog.org/2017/04/25/nyc-drivers-injured-1083-pedestrians-and-cyclists-in-march-and-killed-12/)

In programming things:

 - [Supercharge Vim with Fzf and Ripgrep](https://medium.com/@crashybang/supercharge-vim-with-fzf-and-ripgrep-d4661fc853d2?source=ifttt--------------1) is another hot new super fast search thing.
 - [The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up Code](https://www.facebook.com/notes/kent-beck/the-life-changing-magic-of-tidying-up-code/1544047022294823/) is a well written set of thoughts on code cleanup.
 - [The Promise of a Burger Party](https://kosamari.com/notes/the-promise-of-a-burger-party) via @cjlicata taught me how promises work in Javascript.
 - [Fat, Static, and Happy: Building Bloomberg Lens](https://trackchanges.postlight.com/fat-static-and-happy-building-bloomberg-lens-8a458a10ed2a?source=ifttt--------------1) talks about the wonders of static content serving.

I'm surprised this hasn't been happening more often: [Linux worm turns Raspberry Pis into cryptocurrency mining bots](https://boingboing.net/2017/06/11/mzi8s867ylmc7bspmeh95povxpq3pz.html).

I feel like I read a lot of Recurse Center summaries this week, but apparently only bookmarked two... which is weird... since I bookmark everything I read.

 - [Week 2 at the Recurse Center](https://bckly.com/posts/2017-06-06-rc-week-2.html) by @loganmhb
 - [Never Graduate Week 2017: how we planned and ran our annual alumni week](https://www.recurse.com/blog/114-never-graduate-week-2017-how-we-planned-and-ran-our-annual-alumni-week)


This is a valid point on cloud hosting: [Bandwidth Costs of Amazon, Google and Microsoft](https://www.arador.com/ridiculous-bandwidth-costs-amazon-google-microsoft/).

[My work was in the news last week](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/06/business/media/intercept-reality-winner-russia-trump-leak.html?_r=0). I have no comment, and know nothing, but [Errata Security: How The Intercept Outed Reality Winner](http://blog.erratasec.com/2017/06/how-intercept-outed-reality-winner.html?m=1) was an interesting read from a technical standpoint.

Speaking of operational security, it's being written about more and more lately. I don't agree with everything said in these, but they are all interesting opinions:

 - [OPSEC for Activists, Part 1: The Basics](http://blog.totallynotmalware.net/?p=106)
 - [OPSEC for Activists, Part 2: Packing for a Protest](http://blog.totallynotmalware.net/?p=160)
 - [OPSEC for Activists Part 3: Always Carry A Bandana](http://blog.totallynotmalware.net/?p=286)
 - [Journalist Training Follow-Up (Tech Solidarity)](https://techsolidarity.org/resources/journalist_checkup.html)
 - [Spear Phishing Attacks](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2017/06/spear_phishing_.html)

Finally, I've been researching signing up for either Playstation Vue or Youtube TV, and [Turner CEO: YouTube TV Made A “Big Mistake”](http://www.tubefilter.com/2017/03/02/turner-ceo-youtube-tv-made-big-mistake/) was a good read on what the differences are right now in regards to programming.

Anyways, have a great week!
