Polygon has [a short article](http://www.polygon.com/2015/3/16/8227391/mario-level-design-thoughts) about level design in most recent Mario games. The article is basically useless, but the video [Super Mario 3D World's 4 Step Level Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBmIkEvEBtA&feature=youtube_gdata) is fantastic.

If you don't have five minutes to watch it, the summary is Super Mario 3D World uses the Japanese idea of [Kishōtenketsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kishōtenketsu) for introducing mechanics at a per level scope.

Kishōtenketsu at a very high level:

* Ki: Introduction.
* Shō: Builds upon introduction.
* Ten: Turn or twist.
* Ketsu: Conclusion.

Interesting to think about for interaction and story design.
