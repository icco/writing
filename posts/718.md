This #yearinreview is two years late. But I want to get something down for the history books. 2022 was a good year. The pandemic was easing up, I visited friends and family. Mel and I continued living in Beacon. Work was fun but tumultuous (but no where near as 2023 would be). I picked a bunch of random photos from the year. Trying to keep it to one or two per month. Decided to go with no description because this post is... late. No metrics, no goals, etc. Just some #photos.
