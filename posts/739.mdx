Here's another #happy post for you! I wrote this from the sunny shores of the Bahamas, so I'm doing particularly well.

 - I enjoyed the short post "[Dear Paul Graham, there is no cookie banner law](https://www.amazingcto.com/cookie-banners-are-not-needed/)." I feel like I gave up on this fight ten years ago, but glad to see some folks are still at it.
 - I read all of [The Sword of Kaigen](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/41886271) by M.L. Wang. I was gifted this book by my friend Frankie and it is not at all what I expected. Is it a political thriller? A reimagining of The Last Airbender? A treatise on the dangers of propaganda? A character study on women in bad marriages? I think it's all of these things and more. It could have been 30% shorter, but it is beautifully written and I'd recommend to anyone who likes a bit of epic fantasy.
