In February of 2023, two friends got me some Eurorack synthesizer parts. I had been following the community a bit through posts on [Lines](https://llllllll.co/) and [r/modular](https://web.archive.org/web/20250827002559/https://www.reddit.com/r/modular/), but my knowledge was cursory at best. I had no idea about how deep, expensive and kinda crazy the whole community was.
