I've been trying to get better at not using the words insane or crazy in conversation. For a while, I tried out "bananas" as a replacement, as suggested by @mel_cantrell. But the more I tried it out; I felt like it came off as a code word for crazy.

At [!!con](http://bangbangcon.com/) last week, it was suggested I try out three new replacement words:

 - wild
 - absurd
 - Kafkaesque

So I'm going to give that a try to be more sensitive towards the mental-health community.

Cheers,

/Nat

UPDATE: "weird" and "ridiculous" were also suggested as other good words. Also, fixed a typo.
