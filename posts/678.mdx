Time for a morning #happy post!

I know a bunch of folks at [Keen IO](https://keen.io/), so I was excited to hear [about their acquisition by Scaleworks](https://medium.com/@Scaleworks/keen-io-is-joining-the-scaleworks-family-64869390dea0?source=ifttt--------------1).

I usually keep tech till later in the post, but since we're already up here, I enjoyed these two opposing posts: [Eleven syscalls that rock the world](https://www.cloudatomiclab.com/prosyscall/) and [Eleven syscalls that suck](https://www.cloudatomiclab.com/antisyscall/).

Three interesting github repos I came across:

 - [pressly/imgry](https://github.com/pressly/imgry) : On-demand image resizing in golang
 - [bloomberg/powerfulseal](https://github.com/bloomberg/powerfulseal) : A chaosmonkey for Kubernetes
 - [salemhilal/laurence](https://github.com/salemhilal/laurence) : A tool for caching APIs in Javascript for offline development

I really enjoyed @micahflee's article [Snowdenâ€™s New App Uses Your Smartphone To Physically Guard Your Laptop](https://theintercept.com/2017/12/22/snowdens-new-app-uses-your-smartphone-to-physically-guard-your-laptop/). It made me go down the rabbit hole of trying to find a cheap Android phone. I didn't find a great list or answer, but [Best Budget Phones of 2017](https://www.xda-developers.com/best-budget-phone-of-2017/) was alright.

Speaking of which, I feel like I'm just lost in "Best Of" articles. One that I actually enjoyed reading about was [The Best Electric Skateboard](https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-electric-skateboard/) from @wirecutter. I also enjoyed their [The Best Things We Bought in 2017](https://thewirecutter.com/blog/best-things-we-bought-in-2017/).

I enjoyed All Songs Considered's [The Year In Music 2017](https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2017/12/11/569386464/all-songs-considered-the-year-in-music-2017).

Two nice 2017 articles from the @recursecenter community:

 - @maryrosecook's [Books I read in 2017](http://maryrosecook.tumblr.com/post/168821451146/books-i-read-in-2017)
 - @piratefsh's [Art I Loved in 2017](https://piratefsh.github.io/2017/12/21/compelling-works-of-art-i-discovered-in-2017.html)

Speaking of @recursecenter, I was really excited to read about [RC Pop-up: Two weeks of collaboration and focused work on generative art](https://www.recurse.com/blog/123-rc-pop-up-two-weeks-of-collaboration-and-focused-work-on-generative-art). I really wanted to attend this, but the timing wasn't quite right. That being said, I am really happy it had such a positive result!


Unrelated to all of this, I've been doing lots of crypto trading. And as the year is ending, I'm thinking about taxes. Most articles I came across were pretty full of nonsense, but [Coinbase's Taxes FAQ](https://support.coinbase.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1496488-taxes-faq) was pretty good.

I was really excited to see my college town featured in the NYT: [How Tech Expanded From Silicon Valley to Bubblegum Alley](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/19/business/tech-san-luis-obispo.html).


A flattering review of some content on my work's website, [Topic](https://topic.com): [Maria Bamford Is Here To Help You Through The Christmas Blues](https://www.fastcompany.com/40506019/maria-bamford-is-here-to-help-you-through-the-christmas-blues). Also on Topic, I enjoyed [You are good at things](https://www.topic.com/you-are-good-at-things).


Finally, I'll leave you with [Mansplaining, Explained](https://thenib.com/mansplaining-explained). Because it's the comic we all need.


Have a great holiday!
