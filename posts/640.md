All right kids, #happy February!


[Microsoft announces open source Git Virtual File System](https://betanews.com/2017/02/03/microsoft-git-virtual-file-system-gvfs/). This makes me really excited. In college I helped work on a Git based filesystem, and we never got it quite right. Google has something like this, and I loved using it. Excited for the day when I can just mount all of github.

[Time](https://bluecocoa.com/time/) looks like a neat app. I don't have an iPhone, but young people made it, and it looks slick.

[Y Combinator welcomes ACLU](https://medium.com/ycombinator/welcome-aclu-e45e27aedb6e?source=ifttt--------------1) is weird, but I guess it's one way to solve ACLU's "what do we do with all this money" problem.

A friend posted [The Egg](http://www.galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html) on Facebook. I'm surprised I had never read it before, it's quite good.

I love when people write up how easy Let's Encrypt is, and @ifosteve has done just that: [Setup Let's Encrypt with NGINX](http://redlua.com/post/setup-lets-encrypt-with-nginx/).

[2017 is a Cyberpunk Dystopia](https://thenib.com/cyberpunk-dystopia). 

[GitLab.com Database Incident](https://about.gitlab.com/2017/02/01/gitlab-dot-com-database-incident/) is a fascinating read for software engineers.

I've always enjoyed @yonatanzunger. His rants at Google were quite famous. His newest post on Medium, [Trial Balloon for a Coup?](https://medium.com/@yonatanzunger/trial-balloon-for-a-coup-e024990891d5?source=ifttt--------------1) is quite good as well.

I love @ifixit, and I'm super excited they are celebrating [10 Years of iPhone](http://ifixit.org/blog/8708/10-years-of-iphone/).

[A magical machine learning art tool](https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/02/02/a-magical-machine-learning-tool/) is a neat read by @b0rk.

That's all for this week! Have a good one.
