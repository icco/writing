[To fly, to fall, to fly again](http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21659722-tech-boom-may-get-bumpy-it-will-not-end-repeat-dotcom-crash-fly?fsrc=email_to_a_friend) is an article by The Economist trying to explain the current state of money in the bay area tech scene. While it has a few things that are somewhat dismissive, and I can't tell if the author was serious or not when they used "[the three comma club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzMUrB-Um1Y)" in a sentence, the article is still worth reading. 

The best part of the article was actually [Mapping the fortunes of Silicon Valley: Tech-tonic shifts](http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2015/07/daily-chart-mapping-fortunes-silicon-valley) which is a neat infographic showing companies growing and shrinking in the bay area since 1995.

p.s. I really wish people would stop using the word Millennials in professional writing. It really makes the rest of your work really hard to read.
