I arrived in NYC yesterday, beginning my 101 days in the city.

Day 0 (2015-03-24) was basically a wash: spent the day traveling from SF, finding my AirBnB, eating, sleeping. I did finish my posts describing that I was doing this though, so that's a plus.

Day 1 I wandered around Manhattan and Brooklyn. I tried to get a handle on the subway, which caused many detours and long walks, but over all I feel like I'm starting to get a hang of it all.

I walked from the bottom of Central Park up to the Met and wandered through the Greek, American, Modern and Asian halls. I took pictures of a few pieces that made me think about stuff I could build for Hacker School (which I guess [announced a name change to "Recurse Center"](https://www.recurse.com/blog/77-hacker-school-is-now-the-recurse-center)). I posted the pieces I liked in the [Hacker School Inspiration](https://www.flickr.com/photos/icco/sets/72157649232639604/) Flickr set.

Later I ended up in Bushwick that had some [good coffee](https://foursquare.com/v/ange-noir-cafe/4fa96c2be4b07cb43c3266a9) and some [neat street art](https://www.flickr.com/photos/icco/16930220481/).

I'm trying to nail down what I want to get done in the first month in NYC (three weeks of which will be in HS/RC) and some goals for the first week at school. Here's a rough sketch of what I'm leaning towards so far in [OKR](https://medium.com/startup-tools/okrs-5afdc298bc28) form:

## Establish Good Habits

 - Write a blog post every day about my time in NYC.
 - Walk for 30 minutes every day outside of my commute.
 - Talk to someone I don't know every day
 - Sketch something every day

## Work on projects combining Art and Programming

 - Add dynamically generated mazes to [Karl](https://icco.github.io/karl/)
 - Build a tree generator (something that creates pictures that look like renderings of some of the sculptures in my aforementioned Flickr set).
 - Fix hosting problems (find, build or setup an alternative to Heroku)
 - Fix bugs in and finish podcasting site

All of this is a first pass though, gotta keep thinking about my goals and what I want.
