Apple's [new macbook](https://www.apple.com/macbook/specs/) is interesting if you think of it as a direct competitor to Google's [Pixel](https://www.google.com/chrome/devices/google-chromebook-pixel/#pixel-specs). The Macbook blows the Pixel out of the water, except for ports, and makes me skeptical if I could switch to it. Chrome OS is the real reason I don't want to switch to the Pixel (and the weight).

My setup at work is a 30" monitor I plug my laptop (a 2013 Macbook Air) into and code away on, and when I'm not at my desk, I just code on my laptop. With one port (and the accessories announced so far) it's unclear how I would plug my monitor, my usb stuff (headphone amp and security key) and charge my laptop all at the same time.

Updated:

 - @dmpatierno [points out](https://twitter.com/dmpatierno/status/575331596703637504) that [Apple is now selling an $80 adapter](http://store.apple.com/us/product/MJ1K2AM/A/usb-c-digital-av-multiport-adapter) to solve my use case.
 - @isomer also [brings up](https://twitter.com/isomer/status/575313769183723520) that the USB3.1 spec allow bidirectional power (and other things) and probably hints at Apple having a monitor to act as a hub.
