I'm really stuck right now on #tenbysix. I'm having total architectural block. My brain just needs to code something to make progress, but it's not happening.

I'm going to brain dump on [Billow.in](https://github.com/icco/billowin), the project that I think is causing most of this blocking, and maybe that will free up some thoughts. This brain dump was brought to you by [Moderat iii](http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21754-iii-moderat/) on repeat. 

So I want to build a heroku clone, using as much already written software as possible, but without using anything proprietary (like [Google Cloud Container Builder](https://cloud.google.com/container-builder/docs/) or [Amazon Elastic Load Balancers](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/)) or any full packaged solutions (like [Deis](http://deis.io/) or [CloudFoundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/)).

Some base requirements:

 - Must support Ruby, Go, Python and Node.js.
 - Must be able to deploy from a push to Github.
 - Must be able to run multiple applications from one box.
 - Must restart application if it dies.
 - Must be able to assign DNS, and not need to change ever.
 - Base monitoring must come for free.
 - It needs to be as cheap as possible.

Right now what I'm trying to wrap my head around is what do I need to build after a git push, and then how do I run it?

I like how [Otto](https://www.ottoproject.io/) figures out a lot of stuff for you, so you can have local and remote deployments be identical. One thought I had was to git push to Github, which would trigger a [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) build, which if successful would somehow push to [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/). None of this workflow is supported yet, but it's something I think might work if I do a bunch of hacking on both projects.

Another thought is to start simpler. Use [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) to build AMIs, and just deploy those to EC2. Although now reading the packer docs, I could have packer build a docker container as well... so if I had a docker image, I could push that to [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/swarm/overview/), and then just register that with some sort of admin tool which sets up load balancing and DNS.

Google [has a tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/automated-build-images-with-jenkins-kubernetes) on building a pipeline similar to what I'm proposing above, which could be interesting. [Hashicorp also has a slide deck](http://www.slideshare.net/Docker/orchestrating-docker-with-terraform-and-consul-by-mitchell-hashimoto) that shows a way to do a similar pipeline with just their tools.

Cool, ok, that brain dump helped. So I'm going to try and create a base packer setup that I can run on git push that outputs a docker image that I can run.
