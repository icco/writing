  A unique and surprisingly effective way to pick website colors. Simple,
  visual, and a refreshing alternative to traditional color palette tools.

This is a pretty awesome way to select colors. I love seeing more and more unique ways to interact with the web. This kind of feels like a gimmick, but at the same time is a very effective way to pick colors. I've always liked [Kuler](kuler.adobe.com) and [Color Lovers](http://www.colourlovers.com), but this is so much simpler.
