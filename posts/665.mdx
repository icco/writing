I have meant to publish this for a while. This document is my rough post-mortem template that I use for outages. 

[Google Doc Postmortem Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KwNGtBa9lnfd6-3lrsHExmmdQbtS1MUv3zKLrzntfcY/preview)

Many Google postmortems and postmortems at other organizations I worked at inspired the general structure of this document. 

I hope you find it useful.
