I've been "vibe coding". I hate it.

I find it like working with a small child. sometimes amazing outcomes are created, but regularly the quality is not there. Bad code is written. Ideas are misconstrued. Things are forgotten.

Tasks I have found it incredible at:

- Short snippets, single function generation
- Test generation
- Translating from one library to another
- Language translation, Terraform to Go for example

Things I have found it terrible at:

- Adding new dependencies
- Multi-file projects 
- Anything involving a database

Things I have had mixed results with:

- Debugging
- Documentation generation
