I've been "vibe coding". While the term gives me the total ick, I wanted to talk through some successes and failures.

I find it like working with a small child. sometimes amazing outcomes are created, but regularly the quality is not there. Bad code is written. Ideas are misconstrued. Things are forgotten.

Tasks I have found AI coding tools incredible at:

- Short snippets, single function generation
- Test generation
- Translating from one library to another
- Language translation, Terraform to Go for example

Things I have found AI coding tools terrible at:

- Adding new dependencies
- Multi-file projects 
- Anything involving a database

Things I have had mixed results with:

- Debugging
- Documentation generation

Before I go into specifics, here are others on the topic to compensate for my experiences.

## What I'm using

Ok, first, context. I am using two setups:

1. Cursor w/ [Agent mode](https://docs.cursor.com/chat/agent)
2. Vim w/ [Copilot](https://github.com/github/copilot.vim)
