Let's see. Tuesday. I added a count to the results page of [giftionary](http://www.giftionary.city/).

I thought about how I've wanted to do some hardware projects but haven't gotten to it yet. I like some of these projects, but I have a feeling I won't get to any of them, not enough time.

I went through and upgraded [tachyons](http://tachyons.io/) in some places.

I spent a decent amount of time researching Clinton and the previous Obama campaigns. One of my friends joined up with the Clinton campaign, and so the idea of joining them is kind of tempting. I had one short HR type phone call, and now I'm trying to figure out the pros and cons. Sounds like a pretty cool gig.

For most of the afternoon and evening I fixed up my CodeWords article. I think it's about ready to go technically, but needs some editing before the world sees it.
