I've been meaning to include what I'm reading outside of RC in these logs, and I have failed. I last mentioned my reading on [Day 2](https://web.archive.org/web/20250123161346/https://writing.natwelch.com/post/87). Since then, I have finished [Exile](https://web.archive.org/web/20240119220014/https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66678.Exile), started and finished [Sojourn](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66695.Sojourn) and started [The Innovators](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21856367-the-innovators). I'm just getting started with "The Innovators", but I'm really liking it so far. It's a much more detailed history of computing and the internet then I ever knew. It especially focuses on how at points in time, many people were doing the same thing at the same time.

I read through two chapters of [Game Programmers Black Book](https://web.archive.org/web/20161129030003/http://www.gamedev.net:80/page/resources/_/technical/graphics-programming-and-theory/graphics-programming-black-book-r1698) focusing on the Game of Life. I don't think I really got it though. I want to reread chapter 18 and try and understand better what it's saying.

I spent a lot of time wandering the streets, getting a haircut, listening to podcasts, drinking coffee and thinking about the [new Deus Ex trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syywnSpIVok). I love cyberpunk, I especially love the idea that technology will take over everything. I have always assumed the world would look something like out of the pages of Neuromancer. Heavily urbanized, with weaponized software and hardware available to many. Hardware able to augment our abilities, software able to distribute our ideas, all integrated seamlessly.

Tonight is "Game Night" at Recurse Center, so I'm basically assuming I'll get nothing else done. But sometimes you just need to think.

Other things I read and thought about:
