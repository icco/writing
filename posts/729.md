Whoo #happy!

This was sitting in my drafts, but no idea why I didn't just click the button. So for those of you reading the archives: I actually pressed publish on this 2024-02-15. Whoops.

- [Where does my computer get the time from?](https://dotat.at/@/2023-05-26-whence-time.html) is a great look into how one of my favorite things, NTP, works.
- [Boygenius will eat you alive](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/boygenius-interview-2023) is a fun look at a band I love, Boygenius.
- [NASA launched a streaming service](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-launches-its-first-on-demand-streaming-service-updated-app/)!!!

Have a great one!
