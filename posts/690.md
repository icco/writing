One good read: [Literary Alternatives to “Ghosting” at Parties](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/literary-alternatives-to-ghosting-at-parties)

One good listen: [https://longform.org/posts/longform-podcast-307-jeff-maysh](https://longform.org/posts/longform-podcast-307-jeff-maysh)[Longform Podcast: Jeff Maysh](https://longform.org/posts/longform-podcast-307-jeff-maysh) is a pretty interesting interview about selling things to movie studios.

And my brother took this cool photo during his travels in Japan.
