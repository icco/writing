Hey there kiddos,

I've been thinking lately that I should talk about my firefox setup, so I guess I'll put that right here.

## Theme

 * [Whitehart](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/364)

   A Very nice lightweight theme. Looks great on every OS except OS X. On OS X I just use the default.

## Extensions

 * [Firebug](http://getfirebug.com/)

   Probably the greatest tool a web developer can have. It allows you to inspect JavaScript, CSS, headers, HTML, and much more on the fly. Also if you install [fireCookie](http://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6683), you can inspect those easily too.

 * [Web Developer](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/60)

   This isn't as useful as FireBug, but I've had it around for so long, I still use it. One of the nice features lets you outline all block elements on a page, which is useful for seeing how strange css elements are interacting.

 * [Screengrab!](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1146)

   This gives you a few different options for taking pictures of web pages.

 * [Download Statusbar](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/26)

   Makes downloading things so much less intrusive than the normal download tool, especially if you enable the mini-mode, which I highly recommend.

 * [Weave](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/10868)

   Like [xmarks](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2410), which I used for years and still highly recommend, but syncs everything including your awesome bar, and lets you store it on a server of your own.

 * [AdBlock Plus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1865)

   Blocks ads incredibly well.

 * [Delicious](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3615)

   I still use [delicious](http://delicious.com/calvin166) a lot, and this lets me save things to it easily. I always just turn on classic mode, because all of their new features are pretty annoying.

Anyway, that's about it. I still really love Firefox, especially since 3.6 has made it so much faster. I'm running the 3.7 nightlies on my laptop, which I am enjoying as well. I have yet to figure out if I like firefox because of the way I have customized it or not, but it definitly wins points in my book for being so easy to customize.

Hasta,  
/Nat
