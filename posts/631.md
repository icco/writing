I've been slacking on the #happy posts. So I figure, let's close out the year with one last post.


[Twenty Sixteen](https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2016/12/26/two-thousand-and-sixteen) by @PA_Megacorp was funny. I know think the "2016 was horrible" joke is overdone, because 2017 is definitely going to be worse, but hey, laughs.

I really like the thoughts behind [Better Things in Smaller Packages](http://pketh.org/better-things). I've been talking to @alexbaldwin about this for a while. He pointed me to [Draft](https://draft.nu/), a prolific email newsletter that @nickd runs. Dude makes money by showing that he's an expert on a topic, and funnels that into design work for his consultancy.

[Solitary Socialite](https://sivers.org/soso) was sent to me by @niket. I agree that introvert and extrovert are overly simplistic descriptions, and I liked this post, but he just sounds like a classic introvert...

[List of 2016 box office number-one films in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_2016_box_office_number-one_films_in_the_United_States) was a fun read when trying to remember what films I saw this year.

[Canada declaring internet essential for quality of life](http://www.theverge.com/2016/12/22/14052368/canada-broadband-internet-essential-service) is super exciting. That being said, most first world countries are sitting around [the same level of internet penetration](https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&ctype=l&strail=false&bcs=d&nselm=h&met_y=it_net_user_p2&scale_y=lin&ind_y=false&rdim=region&idim=country:USA:CHN:GBR:JPN:FRA:CAN:IND&ifdim=region&hl=en&dl=en&ind=false). The quality of that internet is questionable still, and I doubt we'll see that much improvement.

[Looking for work](https://alexgaynor.net/2016/dec/23/looking-for-work/) by @alex_gaynor was nice. I really liked how he framed his employment history.

[Do Not Eat, Touch, Or Even Inhale the Air Around the Manchineel Tree](http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/whatever-you-do-do-not-eat-touch-or-even-inhale-the-air-around-the-manchineel-tree) is probably one of the scarier plants I've ever heard of. The funny thing? A conversation about this led to a want to go to DisneyWorld.

[DNA Lounge will be closed soon, without your help](https://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/log/2016/12/19.html) is a plea from @jwz. It's a great place if you live in SF. Also, I like how this post goes through DNA Lounge's history.

I loved the work in [Droneports Could Be the Train Stations of the 21st Century](http://www.archdaily.com/801464/this-student-project-shows-how-droneports-could-be-the-train-stations-of-the-21st-century). 

[The Top 10 New York Dishes of 2016](http://nyti.ms/2hKepO1) by the New York Times was great. Ten places I want to eat in 2017.

[Blade Runner 2049 trailer](http://www.polygon.com/2016/12/19/14005172/blade-runner-sequel-trailer-harrison-ford) is out. Blade Runner is one of my all time favorite movies, so super excited.

[My Priorities for the Next Four Years](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/12/my_priorities_f.html) by [Bruce Schneier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Schneier) is a nice read of how to frame your goals for the Trump presidency.

I also read the first nine books of the [Taltos](https://www.goodreads.com/series/40334-vlad-taltos) series, which were all pretty good.

I hope everyone is having a wonderful holidays. I'll be getting my year in review out soon. 

Cheers,

/Nat
