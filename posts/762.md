Ten years ago, I attended [RC](https://recurse.com). I blogged every day, which you can see at #recursecenter.

When I registered to attend, I was burnt out. I was working in London at Google and it wasn't working out. I liked my coworkers, I found the work interesting, but I was exhausted and sad. After eighteen months I didn't feel like I had friends. I had a director tell me to just get married (I didn't have the heart to tell him I couldn't get anyone to date me). In retrospect, I probably should have stayed another year or two. I would have made more money and probably promoted, but my depression had erased any hope. It was through that a few conversations with friends convinced me to go to what was then Hacker School in NYC. I tried to quit but my manager, bless his soul, convinced me to stay three more months. He fixed a lot about the job. Other very senior engineers came to London and attempted to improve the team and multiple folks put a lot of effort into making my life better. I will forever be greatful to those folks.

I applied to RC in the three months while I stuck around trying to figure things out. I went to the office on weekends and drew huge multi-whiteboard pros/cons diagrams. I hadn't gotten into RC yet, but I had basically decided to go to leave London.

I don't know how much was in my head, but when I got into RC, I was ready to go. I packed up my life, shipped most of it to my parents, and arrived in NYC March 30th, 2015. It was snowing when I landed. I had a few friends in NYC, but I ended up staying in an AirBnb for the first month and then a friend of a friend's spare room for two more months. The next twelve weeks were a blur. It took me about three weeks to recover from burnout. Everyone was so friendly. So smart. So creative. I felt completely out of my depth.
