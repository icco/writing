It's my wife Melissa's birthday, so that's always fun. Had a party a general good times.

But in #happy links-ville: 

- [Hip-Hop Is the Music of Vinyl Librarians](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/15/opinion/hip-hop-vinyl.html?smid=nytcore-android-share) is a fun history and opinion piece.
- I loved seeing the [Fables creator place universe in public domain](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fables-creator-places-wolf-among-us-universe-in-public-domain-amid-clash-with-dc-over-telltale-adaptation). When it was still coming out, I loved reading [Fables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fables_(comics)). Seeing Bill Willingham tell DC that he couldn't fight the lawsuits, so just put all of his work into public domain was amazing.

Didn't do a lot of other internet reading this week, as we had a bunch of outages at work. But next week I'll be at [Strange Loop 2023](https://www.thestrangeloop.com/index.html), hit me up if you'll also be there!
