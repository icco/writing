This week was great! On Tuesday, @hillaryclinton had [a huge win](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/561) in a few states, and that made me incredibly #happy.

This week was a precursor though, because I've got the weekend off, and my brother, @theweirdwelch is coming to visit. Just the anticipation of both of these things make me quite happy as well. But enough real life stuff, let's talk about media consumption.

@xor live tweeted @snowden's talk at LibrePlanet: https://twitter.com/xor/status/711196584281837569. The talk isn't online yet, but it will be at [media.libreplanet.org](https://media.libreplanet.org/) eventually. I particularly liked this quote, which is something I've been thinking about for a little while now:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-cards="hidden" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;If you maintain infrastructure, how can you make sure an attack on you doesn&#39;t attack your users?&quot; dkg <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LibrePlanet?src=hash">#LibrePlanet</a> <a href="https://t.co/jPN1IEZNv5">pic.twitter.com/jPN1IEZNv5</a></p>&mdash; Parker Higgins (@xor) <a href="https://twitter.com/xor/status/711202510497845252">March 19, 2016</a></blockquote>

I went to [this interesting talk](http://whitney.org/Events/FreedomOfInformationAct) by some cool journalists talking about [FOIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_Information_Act_(United_States)) and its roll in journalism.

@Diegor1901 linked me to [Real-time Face Capture and Reenactment of RGB Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohmajJTcpNk&feature=youtu.be), which is incredibly creepy technology.

I listened to [Gaelynn Lea's Tiny Desk Concert](http://www.npr.org/2016/03/10/469966998/gaelynn-lea-tiny-desk-concert?autoplay=true), which is beautiful.

I discovered the cool [NewsDiffs](http://newsdiffs.org/).

xkcd's [It Begins](https://xkcd.com/1656/) made me laugh. I want a twitter bot that does this now.

I also enjoyed reading [Warcraft 3 is still getting patched, almost 14 years after its launch](http://www.polygon.com/2016/3/12/11212024/warcraft-3-patch-history-127).

I hope you have a great week!
