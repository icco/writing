The last few weeks have been weird. I was in PDX for a company off-site, where I got COVID (for the fourth time). I quarantined in a hotel until I was negative, then flew home and quarantined for a few more days in my home. 

During this, I started playing around with the idea of rewriting my blog. I had tried this once about a year ago, and I found my partial rewrite did not work. I tried picking up the git branch I had started, but it was a mess, and COVID brain kept me from making any real progress.

A week after this, I went to a wedding in Bermuda for my friend Matt.

It was a lovely time, but in my free time, I started researching how to beat rewrite a markdown / MDX blog. During this research I learned about two new things: [contentlayer](https://contentlayer.dev/) and [NextJS 13's app folder](https://nextjs.org/docs/app).
