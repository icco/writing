I started writing my submission for [Code Words](https://codewords.recurse.com/). 

I spent an hour or so debugging why ShhParty stopped working. Couldn't come up with a good reason.

Attended a [PGP keysigning party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_signing_party), signed up for [keybase.io](https://keybase.io/icco) and got in a long discussion on the realities of trust and identity.

Took a long walk.

Rewatched [The Wind Rises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wind_Rises).
