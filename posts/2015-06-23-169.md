The New York Times has an article on the new [Guggenheim Helsinki Design](http://nyti.ms/1K7Y8MZ). I really love the design. It reminds me of some of my other favorite museum designs: [SFMOMA](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:San_Francisco_Museum_of_Modern_Art_in_2011.jpg), [Tate Modern](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tate_Modern_viewed_from_Thames_Pleasure_Boat_-_geograph.org.uk_-_307445.jpg), [KIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunst_im_Tunnel) and the [De Young](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:M._H._de_Young_Memorial_Museum.jpg).

The article goes into a longer debate on whether or not the museum should be built, or at least built where it is. It's somewhat negative, but overall a good look into the public's perception of such a building.

I particularly liked this quote:

 > “Architecture should always be incubated within debate,” said the chairman, Mark Wigley, a professor and dean emeritus of the Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation at Columbia University. “Public money especially should never be taken for granted.”

I found it hilarious because the rest of the article is about the people of Helsinki and then the article quotes a Columbia professor, because why not.
