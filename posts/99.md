I spent most of today coding. I went from a blank canvas to [drawing random squares constantly](https://twitter.com/icco/status/585534884313227265) to a [working acorn pattern animation](https://twitter.com/icco/status/585619015634178048).

The Mozilla Developer Pages were the best resource. The have all of the great javascript knowledge.

 - [Canvas API: Basic Animations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Basic_animations)
 - [Game Anatomy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Anatomy)
 - And many others for random questions about including how to do deep copies of arrays.

You can see [my implementation of Conway's Game of Life](https://icco.github.io/life/) or read through [the documented source code](https://icco.github.io/life/docs/).

Not sure if I'll add the ability to pause or to draw or do the `TODO` refactorings I have listed in the code. I'll leave that decision for tomorrow.
