I recently stumbled across @dotmudge's talk from Defcon 21: [Unexpected Stories - From a Hacker Who Made It Inside the Government](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9wXq6oRBnI&feature=youtu.be). It's a really interesting talk focused on stories describing the relationships between the hacker community and the US government.

After the stories, [Joe Grand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Grand) talked about some quotes he remembered  [Peiter Zatko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peiter_Zatko) saying when they were together at the [l0pht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L0pht). Mudge apparently said their two goals were: "making a dent in the universe" and "do what we want to do without losing money".
