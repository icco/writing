I love the internet. I truly believe it is one of the greatest things to happen to modern society. 

But all of the hatred saddens me. [One Week of Harassment on Twitter](http://femfreq.tumblr.com/post/109319269825/one-week-of-harassment-on-twitter) by [Anita Sarkeesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anita_Sarkeesian) is probably one of the most depressing things I've read in a while. Couldn't even get to the end.

I feel like the global hate is getting stronger, not weaker, and that makes me incredibly depressed.
