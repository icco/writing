I want to talk a bit about alerting. I often get asked about my alerting philosophy. Right now, my answer is to usually send them [My Philosophy on Alerting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/199PqyG3UsyXlwieHaqbGiWVa8eMWi8zzAn0YfcApr8Q/edit) by [Rob Ewaschuk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robewaschuk/). Rob also wrote the chapter in the SRE Book [Monitoring distributed systems](https://sre.google/sre-book/monitoring-distributed-systems/) on the topic. I particularly want to direct your attention to one paragraph from that chapter:

> Paging a human is a quite expensive use of an employee’s time. If an employee is at work, a page interrupts their workflow. If the employee is at home, a page interrupts their personal time, and perhaps even their sleep. When pages occur too frequently, employees second-guess, skim, or even ignore incoming alerts, sometimes even ignoring a "real" page that’s masked by the noise. Outages can be prolonged because other noise interferes with a rapid diagnosis and fix. Effective alerting systems have good signal and very low noise.

When working at a smaller company, I believe this expense exponentially grows.
