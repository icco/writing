After my last post, I said I wouldn't do a #happy post on a Wednesday. And yet. Here I am. Weekends have been busy of late, and haven't been able to get a post out. Sorry about that! So here's a midweek treat.

Lately, I've been playing [Stardew Valley](https://stardewvalley.net/). It's been good for 30 minutes of play here and there. I miss Destiny, but just haven't had the time to commit.


@samantha_gold [designed and manufactured some cool earrings and was featured on Motherboard!](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vbze3d/yubikey-earrings)

[A Japanese Home Designed Around a Climbable Earthquake-Proof Bookshelf](http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2017/12/a-japanese-home-designed-around-a-climbable-earthquake-proof-bookshelf/) is awesome. Also from Japan: [Akira Murals!](https://kotaku.com/how-to-make-tokyo-look-cooler-akira-murals-1820791743)

[The 200-year evolution of the can opener](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/11/dont-lose-a-finger-the-200-year-evolution-of-the-can-opener/) is fascinating. I love seeing how design changes over time.

[James Greig's Self-care for the creative soul](https://creativemornings.com/talks/james-greig/1) was a great listen.

[Contrast Guide](https://usecontrast.com/guide) was an interesting education in color as I'm working redesigning this site, slowly but surely.

[Postmortem: Every Frame a Painting](https://medium.com/@tonyszhou/postmortem-1b338537fabc?source=ifttt--------------1) was a fascinating read on the creative process, and got me to go and watch a ton of videos on film design. My favorite was [Satoshi Kon - Editing Space & Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oz49vQwSoTE&feature=youtu.be).

[Deborah Kass](http://pca.st/gsoB) on [Design Matters with Debbie Millman](http://www.debbiemillman.com/designmatters/) was a great listen on the history of pop-art.

In the Pretty Pictures category: [Star Wars Posters Mix Series Iconography With Pop Art Sheen](https://io9.gizmodo.com/these-star-wars-posters-mix-series-iconography-with-pop-1820956544). 


I love D&D, and @wilw's answer to "[What’s the best entry point for Dungeons and Dragons?](http://wilwheaton.net/2017/11/whats-the-best-entry-point-for-dungeons-and-dragons/)" was great. Highly recommend for people interested in playing.

In video game news, one of the greatest video game series of all time is getting a re-release: [Mega Man X 1-8 coming to PC, PS4, Switch and Xbox One](https://www.polygon.com/platform/amp/2017/12/4/16734630/mega-man-x-series-pc-ps4-switch-xbox-one). Also [Capcom announced Mega Man 11](https://kotaku.com/capcom-announces-mega-man-11-1820983671/amp). Time for some jump and shoot platforming!



@EWDurbin put up some [amazing slides on Twitter about working with legacy code bases](https://twitter.com/EWDurbin/status/937501761647939584) which were fascinating and well designed. Also given in the wonderful town of Petaluma, California, which makes me happy.


I love a good look at the inside of someone's bag, so I enjoyed [What’s in your bag, Chaim Gartenberg?](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/2/16717370/whats-in-your-bag-chaim-gartenberg) Reminded me that I've been meaning to put one up here for a bit.


I really enjoyed [Tyler Cowen](https://longform.org/posts/longform-podcast-270-tyler-cowen) on the longform podcast. It lead me to his [Best non-fiction books of 2017](http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2017/12/best-non-fiction-books-2017.html), which is a fantastic list. I wanna read all of these!

Also on Lonform, [Carol Loomis](https://longform.org/posts/longform-podcast-152-carol-loomis) was great.


[Listen Notes](https://www.listennotes.com/?s=logo) is a cool podcast search engine. It's not perfect, but I am enjoying it for finding podcasts about people I like.


I'm super excited that [Wikimedia Foundation funded six Outreachy interns](https://blog.wikimedia.org/2017/12/01/six-outreachy-interns-funded/). I love seeing companies support groups like [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/). Such a neat mission.


[The 5 essential Slack channels you didn’t know your team needed](https://slackhq.com/the-5-essential-slack-channels-you-didnt-know-your-team-needed-a047d0c5acb3) has some good tips on building work culture.

[As A Solo Developer, I Decided To Offer Phone Support](http://plumshell.com/2017/11/30/as-a-solo-app-developer-i-decided-to-offer-phone-support-and-this-is-what-happened/) is a neat read on customer support.

I really enjoy @rwitoff, and his talks lately on Coinbase have been great!

 - [Crushing Tech Debt Through Automation at Coinbase](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/coinbase-technical-debt)
 - [DevOps Wall Street: Security, Scalability, Productivity: Embracing a DevOps Mindset at Coinbase with CircleCI](https://circleci.com/blog/devops-wall-street-security-scalability-productivity-embracing-a-devops-mindset-at-coinbase-with-circleci/)


I talk about keeping time with computers fairly regularly on this blog, so I was excited about the launch announcement of [Amazon Time Sync Service](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/keeping-time-with-amazon-time-sync-service/). [Google Time](https://developers.google.com/time/) has been around for a while, so I'm excited to see diversity in cloud NTP servers.

[Triplebyte's Software Engineer Salary Data](https://triplebyte.com/software-engineer-salary) made the rounds. Slightly concerned about the numbers here, but still interesting to be reminded how batshit the bay area is.

[google/oss-fuzz](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz) is continuous fuzzing of open source software, which is just awesome.

I'm starting to play with [a2o/snoopy](https://github.com/a2o/snoopy), a tool to log every executed command to syslog.


With all of the nonsense about the FCC being full of fake comments and wanting to kill Net Neutrality, [sunlightlabs/fcc-net-neutrality-comments](https://github.com/sunlightlabs/fcc-net-neutrality-comments) is an old but great tool for scraping, parsing and making sense of the flood of comments submitted to the FCC.

[netboot.xyz](https://netboot.xyz/) is cool. Could be fun to setup in a lab.

Also in Linux news, [Ubuntu 17.10: Return of the GNOME](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/11/ubuntu-17-10-return-of-the-gnome/).

I love how much Google is open sourcing lately, and [google/metallb](https://github.com/google/metallb) is just another cool thing.

I really liked [David Karp's resignation letter from Tumblr](https://www.davidslog.com/167947597220/letter-i-just-sent-to-my-team).

I love [Tiny Desk](https://www.npr.org/series/tiny-desk-concerts/), and I enjoyed [Ted Leo's performance](https://www.npr.org/event/music/567746529/ted-leo-tiny-desk-concert). But what I have been really loving is [All Songs Considered](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510019/all-songs-considered) is going through their ten-year history one year at a time. Their 
 [2008 Remembered](http://pca.st/TvOF) talks about the creation of Tiny Desk.

Hope you all have a great day and a solid rest of your week!
