It's time for another #happy post!

Watch

 - [NYT Cooking On The Job](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYG6O_GQCZwjHuu5swGZ6c8sZq6SpC87q) has a fantastic video about [a dishwasher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyHPuYpetbg). I really enjoyed this dive into a day in the life of a very important but rarely thought about role.
 - I rewatched two of my favorite Anime over the weekend: [The Wind Rises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wind_Rises) and [Keep your hands off Eizouken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep_Your_Hands_Off_Eizouken!).

Listen

 - Hank Green guest-hosted one of my favorite podcasts, and it's a delight: [Guest host Hank Green makes Nilay Patel explain why websites have a future](https://www.theverge.com/24087834/hank-green-decoder-podcast-google-youtube-web-media-platforms-distribution-future).
