![My Work Mouse][3]  
[Logitech Anywhere Mouse][5] by [Nat W.][6]

So I was going to write this in depth review of the [Logitech Anywhere Mouse][0].
But then, [Cory Doctorow][2] went ahead and [wrote a great review of it][1].

I entirely agree with everything he says. I bought one in early August when
trying to find a new mouse for work. I needed something that worked on my glass
desk, felt good in my hand, and was under $80. The Anywhere MX did all of these
things, so I went ahead and ordered one from amazon.

It worked great, and I happily used it for four months. I loved it so much in
fact that earlier this month I bought another one for my home. The mouse works
great in Linux, Windows, and OS X (I use all three with it everyday), without
the need for any extra software. The scroll wheel works really well, and I
actually prefer the separate button for middle clicking, it just seems more
intuitive than clicking a wheel down.

Before, I bought my second Anywhere mouse, I also briefly tried out the
[Performance MX][4]. While I can see some people liking it, I found the mouse
to be large, bulky and uncomfortable. I was especially bothered by the fact
that on this mouse you used the button to toggle the scroll speeds while the
wheel was your third button. I really wish companies would realize that
consistency in interface is key. Anyway, I used it for a week and then returned
it, which thanks to Amazon being awesome, was no hassle at all.

Anyway, I highly recommend the [Logitech Anywhere MX mouse][0].

cya later,
