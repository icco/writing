I'm here to spread #happy, because wow this past week sucked.

Sure, there's context here if you watch Game of Thrones, but [Kit Harington pretending to be a dragon](https://www.buzzfeed.com/kimberleydadds/emilia-clarke-shared-a-hilarious-behind-the-scenes-video-of) is a friendly reminder not to take yourself too seriously.

[Tina Fey eats cake on 'Weekend Update'](http://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/tv/tina-fey-snl-uva-alum-urges-protesting-cake-weekend-update-n793786?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_ma) is funny. As far as I can tell, the internet interpreted this in many ways, angering some, making others laugh, and maybe making a few think. For me, it was a reminder that we can never stop fighting hatred and oppression, but also a reminder that sometimes you need to disconnect and eat some cake. Take care of yourself folks.

Speaking of taking care of yourself, [selfcare.tech](http://selfcare.tech/) is a list of developer resources for self-care.

I live with someone who is allergic to peanuts, so the news that an immunotherapy trial had [cured peanut allergy in the majority of child subjects](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/17/peanut-allergy-cured-in-majority-of-children-in-immunotherapy-trial?CMP=twt_gu) is super exciting.

[Public Enemy](https://harpers.org/archive/2017/09/public-enemy/) by Harper's Magazine is hilarious. And I thought it was satire until I read the NYT coverage: [Jury Selection in Martin Shkreli Trial Begins With Name Calling](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/26/business/dealbook/martin-shkreli-trial-jury-selection.html).

I don't know how I feel about this, but [programmer creates an organization to unmask child predators](http://money.cnn.com/2017/08/14/technology/business/innocent-lives-foundation-hackers-child-predators/index.html) is impressive.

If you're interested in hardware security keys, [ImperialViolet's Security Keys](https://www.imperialviolet.org/2017/08/13/securitykeys.html) is an excellent write-up.

CityMapper's [Using data to figure out traffic](https://medium.com/citymapper/using-data-to-figure-out-traffic-d6b1262589?source=ifttt--------------1) is cool.

[Hayao Miyazaki has officially returned to Studio Ghibli!](https://i-d.vice.com/en_au/article/zmmxmy/hayao-miyazaki-has-officially-returned-to-studio-ghibli) What more do you want?!?

In the world of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency news, two things:

 - [fork.lol](http://fork.lol) shows when it's more profitable to mine which coin
 - [Bitcoin vaults to new record above $4K](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/12/bitcoin-vaults-to-new-record-above-4k-boosted-by-japan-and-multiplying-its-value-fourfold.html) is a decent write-up by CNBC on what's currently driving Bitcoin growth

[The world’s best Dota 2 players just got destroyed by a killer AI from Elon Musk’s startup](https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/11/16137388/dota-2-dendi-open-ai-elon-musk) is amazing, as is the follow-up blog post by the company itself: [More on Dota 2](https://blog.openai.com/more-on-dota-2/).

"[Ask HN: What mistakes in your experience does management keep making?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15033156)" is just depressing because these problems are so widespread, and I've seen them everywhere I have worked. I think we need better management training.

[Dribbble Overtime with Jared Erondu](https://dribbble.com/overtime/2017/07/25/episode-18-jared-erondu) was a great listen. His [Playbook](https://askplaybook.com/) site is super neat about working in the design world.

I love everything @jxnblk does, I love [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/), and I'm slowly learning React, so his [tachyons-components](https://github.com/jxnblk/tachyons-components) excites me.

[GoogleChrome/puppeteer: Headless Chrome Node API](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) is cool looking, and I can probably use for a few side projects I've got cooking.

In infrastructure reading this week, I enjoyed these repositories and articles:

 - [Kubernetes at GitHub | GitHub Engineering](https://githubengineering.com/kubernetes-at-github/)
 - [remind101/conveyor: A fast build system for Docker images](https://github.com/remind101/conveyor)
 - [remind101/empire: A PaaS built on top of Amazon EC2 Container Service (ECS)](https://github.com/remind101/empire)
 - [mapbox/patrol: A general purpose serverless monitoring framework](https://github.com/mapbox/patrol)
 - [TunnelBear Completes Industry-First Consumer VPN Public Security Audit](https://www.tunnelbear.com/blog/tunnelbear_public_security_audit/)

[We Offered Matching Funds for Open Source, Here’s What Happened.](https://medium.com/open-collective/matching-funds-for-open-source-9653a81f8dcb?source=ifttt--------------1) is a cool case study on financing open-source software.

[Why We Terminated Daily Stormer](https://blog.cloudflare.com/why-we-terminated-daily-stormer/) by CloudFlare is a super weird read given their past history.

[DeviantArt Is Switching To HTTPS](https://www.deviantart.com/journal/DeviantArt-Is-Switching-To-HTTPS-697996906) makes me super happy. I've wanted this for a long time.

Some days you just want to look at beautiful architecture. I mean, that's me every day, but here were my two favorites this week:

 - [Own two waterfalls, 60 acres of land, and a cabin upstate for $925K](https://www.6sqft.com/own-two-upstate-waterfalls-60-acres-of-land-and-a-cabin-for-925k/)
 - [Carney Logan Burke creates barn-shaped guest house in rural Wyoming](https://www.dezeen.com/2017/08/14/carney-logan-burke-barn-shaped-guest-house-rural-wyoming/#utm_source=instagram-story&utm_medium=social)

Have a great week!
