For the past year, I've been told on a few occasions I spread myself too thin. Today alone, I worked on eight different projects. I'm using [Toggl](https://www.toggl.com) to try and track how long I work on different things. It's all pretty eye opening.

I've also started reading through [Getting Things Done](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1633.Getting_Things_Done) and have added [Time Management for System Administrators
](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/376236.Time_Management_for_System_Administrators) to my queue for the weekend. Hopefully I can come up with some sort of strategy to help me finish things.
