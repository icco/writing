## How did I do on my 2024 goals?

In [my 2024 goals post](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/731), I set out the following goals:

 - Keep a public culture consumption diary
 - Blog once a month
 - Finish locative garden
 - Make music once a week
 - Go fishing once a month
 - 30 minutes of exercise three times a week
 - Remove all credit card debt
 - Find a monthly in person social thing



Looking back, I'd say my success was mixed. [Will fill in actual progress when writing the final version]
