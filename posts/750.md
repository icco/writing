Hello friends!

Welcome to my fourteenth annual yearly review post! The tradition continues. Yes, I definitely missed 2022 and 2023, but I put up very delayed versions recently. So maybe not truly annual, but what can you do. You can read past years at #yearinreview.

2024 was a weird year. Work was incredibly stressful as the year started with layoffs. We pushed through and had a lot of success, but startup life is exhausting. Some days I definitely miss working for large companies. Other days I love the excitement and challenge of being part of such a small team.

Mel started a Masters program at the London School of Economics in September, which also lead to a very unusual Autumn. But more on that below.

Here we go!

# January & February

We arrived home from a month long road trip traveling to the west coast and back on New Years day. We were ragged and exhausted but glad to be home.

The next two months we mostly laid low, recovering from our long adventure. Briefly though, I went back to the west coast, California and Arizona, for a work trip. During which I hung out with my cousin Jared whom I hadn't seen in ~20 years. We also had two guests, my brother Travis and our good friend Carl.

# March

In March, we went on a trip to the Bahamas for our friend Sue's birthday. Mel has been before, but this was my first time, and it was wonderful. I normally am more of a mountain guy than a beach guy, but this trip was just delightful. 

# April

Melissa was accepted to the London School of Economics and Political Science. We wanted to figure out where she might live if she accepted, so we made a quick weekend trip to London. It was a whirlwind weekend, but we had a blast and learned a lot.

Also, we stared at a solar eclipse.

# May

Oh my, May. In May my brother Travis broke his leg while rock climbing in Yosemite. It was a real bad break (multiple compound fracture). With the help of my friend Xander, I flew to SFO and drove to Fresno. Then helped Travis get checked out of the hospital, get all of his stuff and shuttle him to my parent's house in Santa Rosa. 

I ended up staying in California for a week or so to help Travis. I also got to see some friends and celebrate my mom's birthday.

When I got back to NY, Mel and I celebrated out sixth anniversary!

# June & July

June and July were a whirlwind. Melissa went to the Montreal Grand Prix with our friend McKenna. Both of us went down to DC for our friend's Audrey and Pat's wedding. While there we caught a Washington Nationals game with Phoenix and wandered the Smithsonian, as you do.

I went to Palm Springs, CA for work, which was the hottest place I have ever been to.

I weirdly took barely any photos in December... 

# Goals

## How did I do on my 2024 goals?

In [my 2024 goals post](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/731), I set out the following goals:

 - Keep a public culture consumption diary
 - Blog once a month
 - Finish locative garden
 - Make music once a week
 - Go fishing once a month
 - 30 minutes of exercise three times a week
 - Remove all credit card debt
 - Find a monthly in person social thing

I posted [an update in July](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/747).

### Writing: Keep a public culture consumption diary, Blog once a month, Finish locative garden.

No major update here since I posted my update, but I am happy with the progress I've made. I wish I had better news about locative garden, but overall, I'm happy that I'm regularly writing.

### Mental Health: Make music once a week, Go fishing once a month, 30 minutes of exercise three times a week, Find a monthly in person social thing.

I'm regularly playing D&D at the Gunks Gaming Guild in New Paltz. I'm regularly making music. Exercise and fishing I did ok with, but in general not great.

### Finances: Remove all credit card debt

I need to write more about debt, my struggles and my feelings about it. I'm not ready to write in detail yet though, my shame around debt is something I'm still working through.

That being said, I made some really good progress in December after lots of research and talking to various institutions. Shoutout to [r/debtfree](https://www.reddit.com/r/debtfree/) for providing me some needed inspiration, and my therapist for helping me through the shame portions of it.

## Goals for 2025

### Improve Mental Health

- Measure mood every day
- Take meds every day
- Do at least 10 push-ups and 10 sit-ups every day

### Make Art Publicly

- Ship Sub Alpine Drift Album One

### Decrease Debt
