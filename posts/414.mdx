Whoops, a #happy post I forgot to post.

I realized I'd never finished [Kill la Kill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_la_Kill), so I've been binging it in my spare time. The show is hilarious. Totally destroys with its wonderful parody of fan service, action sequences and plot.

Plus, the art is generally fantastic:

If you don't like anime, you probably won't enjoy it, but hey, that's ok too.
