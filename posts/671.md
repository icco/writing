I tried to write this yesterday, but it was difficult to feel happy with another mass shooting in the news. So this #happy post goes out to all those in Vegas, and those with friends and families who were injured. Also still thinking about those in Puerto Rico, Texas, and Florida.

Sigh. Ok, well here are some distractions.

[The Secret World of Tiny Phones That Go Inside Your Butt](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/zngpz4/prison-phones-that-go-up-your-bum) made me think of about [that Bob's Burgers episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hng5GGLgFAg). Also just a fascinating article in general.

Speaking of Bob's Burgers: ["Bob's Burgers" made a Fan-animated episode](https://www.buzzfeed.com/alivelez/bobs-burgers-fan-art-for-the-win?ref=bffbmain#.hs7YaplB5). It's pretty great.


Look, I always pause a bit before posting a listicle on here, but @mel_cantrell sent me [18 times the Internet Nailed What Being a Millennial Is actually Like](https://www.buzzfeed.com/katangus/im-never-going-to-retire#.wkkmzzRJ2), and I laughed. I laughed really hard. So, yeah, there you go.

Two interesting episodes from [The Outline World Dispatch](https://theoutline.com/post/1359/the-outline-world-dispatch):

 - [10/2/2017: Is Telegram connected to the Kremlin? - The Outline World Dispatch](http://pca.st/cth6)
 - [9/28/2017: Neo Yokio’s rich universe - The Outline World Dispatch](http://pca.st/TGbP)

[American Surrogate](http://www.npr.org/2017/09/06/548819214/rough-translation-american-surrogates) is a fascinating listen about women birthing other people's children.

Betterridge's law says that the answer to "[Is Europe's ghostliest train station about to rise again?](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-41445860)" is no, but this still has a lot of pretty pictures.

[Three Scientists Win Nobel Prize in Medicine](https://nyti.ms/2fJw8tL) for studying the human cicadian rhythm.

[Amazon is adaptin Snow Crash and others into TV shows](http://variety.com/2017/tv/news/amazon-studios-lazarus-snow-crash-ringworld-1202576048/) which is pretty exciting.

SpaceX put up a video. I want this in my life: [BFR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqE-ultsWt0&feature=youtu.be)

I gave a talk at StrangeLoop in St. Louis, which was a lot of fun: ["Practical Applications of the Dickerson Pyramid" by Nat Welch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWAfTAu0Mww&feature=youtu.be)

[Chitlins at Bergdorf’s](https://gimletmedia.com/episode/chitlins-at-bergdorfs/) is a great look at fashion and black culture. Also related, [How the LGBT community created voguing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJ6fqQX_e9U&feature=youtu.be) is a good watch.

I haven't read [Apprenticeship Patterns](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/index.html) yet, but it looks great and was recommended to me at StrangeLoop.

[The Repressive, Authoritarian Soul of “Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends”](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/rabbit-holes/the-repressive-authoritarian-soul-of-thomas-the-tank-engine-and-friends); I was raised on this show... and now I'm rethinking my childhood.

[The 6 Fundamental Concepts of Systems Thinking](https://medium.com/disruptive-design/tools-for-systems-thinkers-the-6-fundamental-concepts-of-systems-thinking-379cdac3dc6a?source=ifttt--------------2) is a nice article on systems thinking.

I think it's really cool that [Ikea has bought TaskRabbit](https://www.recode.net/2017/9/28/16377528/ikea-acquisition-taskrabbit-shopping-home-contract-labor). Really interested to see where this goes.

The thought that [a Human can beat a Horse in an endurance race](http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/10/20/450068114/heres-how-you-can-outrun-a-horse) makes me want to get off my ass.

I learned about [General Transit Feed Specification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Transit_Feed_Specification) from [a great interview with Steph Hannon](https://venturebeat.com/2017/09/25/thriving-in-chaos-podcast/). @twephanie is an amazing human.

I love learning about [abandoned tube stations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOLQ3GqfNrQ&feature=youtu.be).

[Illustrating Group Theory: A Coloring Book](http://www.coloring-book.co/) is a great piece of work by @AlexandraBerke.

[Sonobuoy Kubernetes Scanner](https://blog.heptio.com/introducing-heptio-sonobuoy-scanner-a-web-based-tool-to-ensure-your-kubernetes-cluster-is-properly-9a0bb2c340b8?source=ifttt--------------2) is a neat tool. I'm hoping to play with it more next week.

I also wanna play with [ShellCheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck), a static analysis tool for shell scripts.

[Banned! Six Cartoonists on Their Favorite Censored Books](https://thenib.com/cartoonists-on-banned-books-week) was interesting.

I got lost in two Kendrick songs at some point last week:

 - [Kendrick Lamar – HUMBLE. Lyrics | Genius Lyrics](https://genius.com/Kendrick-lamar-humble-lyrics)
 - [Kendrick Lamar – Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe Lyrics | Genius Lyrics](https://genius.com/Kendrick-lamar-bitch-dont-kill-my-vibe-lyrics)

I started reading [the Craft series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/91029-craft-sequence), and I enjoyed reading about the author, [Max Gladstone](https://whatever.scalzi.com/2013/10/31/the-big-idea-max-gladstone/).

Here's another pup to close us out.

Good luck out there. Stay strong.
