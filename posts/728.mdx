I've been at Laurel[^laurel] for a bit over three years. It is a small Series B startup, and it can be stressful. I often blame startup life for my lack of writing. That being said, one thing Laurel does that I really like is guarantee one three day weekend every month. Sometimes that's a national holiday, but if there isn't a national holiday, Laurel still declares a day off. 

[^laurel]: Laurel was formally known as Time By Ping. We [changed our name back in February 2023](https://www.laurel.ai/resources-post/goodbye-time-by-ping-hello-laurel-the-story-behind-our-new-identity).

One of these days each year is Randa Day. Randa was the name of our [CEO Ryan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-alshak-72815722/)'s mom who passed away and inspired the company's creation. The company asks all employees to take the day off to celebrate her. In the words of one of our founders, [Kourosh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kouroshz/):

> Randa taught us not to never take time for granted. She pushed us to solve time for the world. Tomorrow isn’t an ordinary long weekend; it is our Randa Day. It’s the day we ask you to intentionally take a moment out of your busy day-to-day to think about your purpose and why you’re working as hard as you are to build Laurel and deliver it to the world.

I have four drafts sitting in my blog (which I'll probably delete after I post this) about joining this company. I often wonder if this was the right choice, leaving a stable company like Google in 2020 to go bet on a company that hadn't figured out product market fit. I think about money left on the table by leaving when I did. I think about the low percentages of startups that succeed, and the even smaller percentages of employees that profit from a startup exit. I debate the pros and cons of being remote. I wonder all sorts of things, doubt is never ending.

Given all of that wondering and doubt, I'm surprised to find that the mission of the company, which is "To return time", still resonates with me after three years. The idea that time is a truly finite resource is a fact that I think about often. The company's attempt to help those who sell their time to both accurately define their time, and make sure they are fairly compensated for how they spend that time weirdly hits home to me. Lawyers and accountants  are our main customers currently, and they are regularly the villains. People think they are out to steal your money, or are a sign of government and legal corruption. I hear commentary at that level at least once a week while out and about, and I always have to pause, because these "villains" are who I spend my day trying to help. 

There are probably a few lawyers and accountants out there like that, but most that I have met are just trying to do their job. They work on incredibly tight deadlines, work long hours, and help people navigate the complicated worlds of law and finance. Our data shows that many of these folks under-bill their time by up to thirty percent, often because of inaccurate time keeping and the fear of over-billing (which is a crime for lawyers in the United States). We are attempting to empower these folks to be more honest about how they spend their time, and also hopefully make them some more money while doing so (you can't bill for all of your time, there's laws about that too), which may end with their customers paying a more money. But think about the underlying premise: working 30% more every day than you are compensated for. If you were working the line at a restaurant, that's often two or more hours of overtime pay.

If you're a salary worker, you may think, I work more than 40 hours a week all of the time, who cares? My response has become simple: do you understand how you spend that time? I know I don't. I am terrible at time management. It's one of the core reasons I failed out of university originally: I wasn't being honest with myself about how I spend my time. It has been fifteen years since I first honestly had to confront the downsides of poor time management[^disabilities], and I still struggle with this to this day. I have tried so many apps, implemented hundreds of systems, been deep in the productivity culture wars, and still struggle. There's no magic button to press and magically says "oh here, now you understand how you spend your time". This is such a hard problem, our founders have been working on it since 2015, and we're just now starting to get traction with a product that helps two small industries understand how they spend their time. We have had to constantly iterate and learn about how different types of people, who all do very similar jobs[^hottake], think about time in very different ways.

[^disabilities]: And learning disabilities, but that's a post for another day.
[^hottake]: This is probably the hottest take in this article. Tell two different groups of lawyers or accountants they do the same job and you'll probably get stabbed.

... bring it back to thoughts on three years here, close it out
