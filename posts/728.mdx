I've been at Time By Ping / Laurel (we changed our name back in February) for almost three years. It's a startup, and it can be stressful. I often blame startup life for my lack of writing. But one thing Laurel does that I really like is guarantee one three day weekend every month. Sometimes that's a national holiday, but if there isn't a national holiday, Laurel still declares a day off. 

One of these each year is Randa Day. Randa was the name of our CEO Ryan's mom and the company asks all employees to take the day off to celebrate her. In the words of our COO Kourosh:

> "Randa taught us not to never take time for granted. She pushed us to solve time for the world. Tomorrow isn’t an ordinary long weekend; it is our Randa Day. It’s the day we ask you to intentionally take a moment out of your busy day-to-day to think about your purpose and why you’re working as hard as you are to build Laurel and deliver it to the world."
