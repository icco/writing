I've been at Time By Ping / Laurel (we changed our name back in February) for almost three years. It's a startup, and it can be stressful. I often blame startup life for my lack of writing. But one thing Laurel does that I really like is guarantee one three day weekend every month. Sometimes that's a national holiday, but if there isn't a national holiday, Laurel still declares a day off. 

One of these days each year is Randa Day. Randa was the name of our CEO Ryan's mom and the company asks all employees to take the day off to celebrate her. In the words of our COO Kourosh:

> "Randa taught us not to never take time for granted. She pushed us to solve time for the world. Tomorrow isn’t an ordinary long weekend; it is our Randa Day. It’s the day we ask you to intentionally take a moment out of your busy day-to-day to think about your purpose and why you’re working as hard as you are to build Laurel and deliver it to the world."

I have four drafts sitting in my blog (which I'll probably delete after I post this) about joining this company. I often wonder if this was the right choice, leaving a stable company like Google in 2020 to go bet on a company that hadn't figured out product market fit. I think about money left on the table by leaving when I did. I think about the low percentages of startups that succeed, and the even smaller percentages of employees that profit from a startup exit. I debate the pros and cons of being remote. I wonder all sorts of things, doubt is never ending.

Given all of that wondering and doubt, I'm surprised to find that the mission of the company, which is "To return time" still resonates with me still after three years.
