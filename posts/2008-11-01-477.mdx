So I was reading <a title="The Knight Writer: The Definitive Plan" href="http://johnbknight.blogspot.com/2008/10/definitive-plan.html">John's Post</a> and I started to think about my life plan. Needless to say, it's not really a plan, but more of an idea. This idea being "make others happy, be happy, and stay happy."

I've tried writing this post a few different ways, but I think John's little list got me to at least make my own list, so I can avoid writing the epic novel that would be my outlook on life (not to mention the fact that it's ever changing...). But none the less, john made a list, so I figured I would make a list.

This list is not in order in any sort.
<ul>
	<li>Develop a web-application that is used by 10,000 people</li>
	<li>Get my name in the credits of some piece of art (not sure if I want to include software as art, if so I've done this, more on that later...)</li>
	<li>Eat</li>
	<li>Sleep</li>
	<li>Hike the John Muir Trail</li>
	<li>Live in Boston</li>
	<li>Live in Europe</li>
	<li>Visit Japan</li>
	<li>Turn 21</li>
	<li>Be Happy</li>
	<li>Volunteer</li>
	<li>Become a Teacher</li>
	<li>Visit every National Forest in the USA</li>
</ul>
Anyway, that's my list. What's your list?
