I am really slipping on these #tenbysix updates. I must do better this week.

## Stuff I worked on last week:

Not only did my update slip, I really didn't get much done. I just got graphs up on [Creepermon](https://github.com/icco/creepermon). You can see my monitoring at https://monitor.natwelch.com/.
