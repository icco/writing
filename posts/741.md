#happy time.

Watch

 - I watched [3 Body Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_Body_Problem_(TV_series)) and it was really thrilling. Excited for the next season. Great Science Fiction with a lot of unique ideas.
 - The [Roadhouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_House_(2024_film)) remake was a fun and engaging romp and action film. People get punched and stuff blows up. Escalation ensues.
 - I also watched [The Covenant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Ritchie%27s_The_Covenant). It's mostly just a good military action movie, and beats you over the head with the theme "don't abandon your coworkers."

Listen

 -  [Why Nintendo sued a game emulator out of existence â€” and what might happen next](https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/4/24121448/why-nintendo-sued-a-game-emulator-out-of-existence-and-what-might-happen-next) was an interesting deep dive on video game emulation and how it's affected by law.
 -  [Japan's Lost Decade](https://www.npr.org/2024/04/03/1197958583/japan-lost-decade) by Planet Money was an interesting history of the economy of Japan in the last thirty years.

Read

 -  I enjoyed GQ's profile on [Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/trent-reznor-atticus-ross-interview-2024).

Play

 - I discovered [Convert Wiki Tables to CSV](https://wikitable2csv.ggor.de/). I've wanted a tool like this forever. Saved me a bunch of time this week.
 - I moved my Plex server to a new machine with higher processing power, which worked really well. Over the next week I'll be moving this website and other websites I run to the old machine! Lower cloud costs here I come.

I hope you have a great week!
