At the beginning of the year, I wrote [Goals for 2024](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/731). It's amazing to me it has been six months since I wrote that. It makes me realize how much time passes and how easily it is to forget things, or drop habits when something comes up.

My goals were as follows:

- Keep a public culture consumption diary
- Blog once a month
- Finish locative garden
- Make music once a week
- Go fishing once a month
- 30 minutes of exercise three times a week
- Remove all credit card debt
- Find a monthly in person social thing

It all seemed so reasonable! Some progress has been made, but also some stuff has definitely slipped.

Lets group these into to category and take a look at them:

## Writing: Keep a public culture consumption diary, Blog once a month, Finish locative garden.

My friend Sumana has been a huge help here, she and I have been meeting roughly once a week to write over video-conference. I've made a lot of progress on locative, blogged a little and I had a stint where I was regularly posting #happy posts.

So by the numbers: In six months, I did two of six full blog posts. I also posted #happy posts 11 out of 26 weeks.

## Mental Health: Make music once a week, Go fishing once a month, 30 minutes of exercise three times a week, Find a monthly in person social thing

For the fishing and exercise portions, I had fits and spurts. I messed up my ankle at one point due to not stretching well. But I did go fishing a few times, and I had weeks where I regularly did exercise. Also a lot of weeks where I didn't.

Music making has been much more of a success story. I'm pretty regularly making music once a week. Even if it's just a quick break before a meeting, having a little music station right next to my work desk has been great.

I just recently found a monthly social thing though! Shout out to all of the friends and acquaintances who sent suggestions: [Trout Unlimited Mid-Hudson](https://www.midhudsontroutunlimited.org/), [Sound](https://luckdragon.space/event/sound.html), [Lit Lit](https://donnaminkowitz.com/lit-lit/) and [Club Draw](https://soyrosendale.com/event/club-draw-session-25/). I ended up going with Gunks.
