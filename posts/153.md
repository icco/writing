Slow day today. I went to [The Ulitimate Science Street Fair](http://www.worldsciencefestival.com/programs/ultimate-science-street-fair/?promo=WSFWSF) in Washington Square Park with a few people from RC. We walked around for about an hour before the heat started to get to me and I ran back and hid in a room with AC.

In the afternoon, I built http://traviscwelch.com/ for my brother as part of his graduation photo board thingy (he graduates from Highschool this upcoming weekend). More practice with [tachyons](https://tachyons.io/) was nice.

I also watched episodes from [Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gargantia_on_the_Verdurous_Planet). An interesting mecha anime, although is very reminiscent of [Full Metal Panic!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Metal_Panic!).

Lots of rain and thunderstorms in the evening. I wish it was always like this. Rain is so much better than the heat.
